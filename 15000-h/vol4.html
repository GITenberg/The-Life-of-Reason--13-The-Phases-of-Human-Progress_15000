<p>THE BASIS OF ART IN INSTINCT AND EXPERIENCE</p>

<p>Man affects his environment, sometimes to good purpose.&mdash;Art is plastic
instinct conscious of its aims.&mdash;It is automatic.&mdash;So are the ideas it
expresses.&mdash;We are said to control whatever obeys us.&mdash;Utility is a
result.&mdash;The useful naturally stable.&mdash;Intelligence is docility.&mdash;Art is
reason propagating itself.&mdash;Beauty an incident in rational art,
inseparable from the others. Pages <a href="#Page_3">3</a>-<a href="#Page_17">17</a></p>


<p><a href="#CHAPTER_II"><b>CHAPTER II</b></a></p>

<p>RATIONALITY OF INDUSTRIAL ART</p>

<p>Utility is ultimately ideal.&mdash;Work wasted and chances missed.&mdash;Ideals
must be interpreted, not prescribed.&mdash;The aim of industry is to live
well.&mdash;Some arts, but no men, are slaves by nature.&mdash;Servile arts may
grow spontaneous or their products may be renounced.&mdash;Art starts from
two potentialities: its material and its problem.&mdash;Each must be definite
and congruous with the other.&mdash;A sophism exposed.&mdash;Industry prepares
matter for the liberal arts.&mdash;Each partakes of the other. Pages <a href="#Page_18">18</a>-<a href="#Page_33">33</a></p>


<p><a href="#CHAPTER_III"><b>CHAPTER III</b></a></p>

<p>EMERGENCE OF FINE ART</p>

<p>Art is spontaneous action made stable by success.&mdash;It combines utility
and automatism.&mdash;Automatism fundamental and irresponsible.&mdash;It is tamed
by contact with the world.&mdash;The dance.&mdash;Functions of gesture.&mdash;Automatic
music. Pages <a href="#Page_34">34</a>-<a href="#Page_43">43</a></p>

<p>MUSIC</p>

<p>Music is a world apart.&mdash;It justifies itself.&mdash;It is vital and
transient.&mdash;Its physical affinities.&mdash;Physiology of music.&mdash;Limits of
musical sensibility.&mdash;The value of music is relative to them.&mdash;Wonders
of musical structure.&mdash;Its inherent emotions.&mdash;In growing specific they
remain unearthly.&mdash;They merge with common emotions, and express such as
find no object in nature.&mdash;Music lends elementary feelings an
intellectual communicable form.&mdash;All essences are in themselves good,
even the passions.&mdash;Each impulse calls for a possible congenial
world.&mdash;Literature incapable of expressing pure feelings.&mdash;Music may do
so.&mdash;Instability the soul of matter.&mdash;- Peace the triumph of
spirit.&mdash;Refinement is true strength. Pages <a href="#Page_44">44</a>-<a href="#Page_67">67</a></p>


<p><a href="#CHAPTER_V"><b>CHAPTER V</b></a></p>

<p>SPEECH AND SIGNIFICATION</p>

<p>Sounds well fitted to be symbols.&mdash;Language has a structure independent
of things.&mdash;Words, remaining identical, serve to identify things that
change.&mdash;Language the dialectical garment of facts.&mdash;Words are wise
men's counters.&mdash;Nominalism right in psychology and realism in
logic.&mdash;Literature moves between the extremes of music and
denotation.&mdash;Sound and object, in their sensuous presence, may have
affinity.&mdash;Syntax positively representative.&mdash;Yet it vitiates what it
represents.&mdash;Difficulty in subduing a living medium.&mdash;Language
foreshortens experience.&mdash;It is a perpetual mythology.&mdash;It may be apt or
inapt, with equal richness.&mdash;Absolute language a possible but foolish
art Pages <a href="#Page_68">68</a>-<a href="#Page_86">86</a></p>

<p>Force of primary expressions.&mdash;Its exclusiveness and
narrowness.&mdash;Rudimentary poetry an incantation or charm.&mdash;Inspiration
irresponsible.&mdash;Plato's discriminating view.&mdash;Explosive and pregnant
expression.&mdash;Natural <a name="Page_-3" id="Page_-3" />history of inspiration.&mdash;Expressions to be
understood must be recreated, and so changed.&mdash;Expressions may be recast
perversely, humourously, or sublimely.&mdash;The nature of prose.&mdash;It is more
advanced and responsible than poetry.&mdash;Maturity brings love of
practical truth.&mdash;Pure prose would tend to efface itself.&mdash;Form alone,
or substance alone, may be poetical.&mdash;Poetry has its place in the
medium.&mdash;It is the best medium possible.&mdash;Might it not convey what it is
best to know?&mdash;A rational poetry would exclude much now thought
poetical.&mdash;All apperception modifies its object.&mdash;Reason has its own
bias and method.&mdash;Rational poetry would envelop exact knowledge in
ultimate emotions.&mdash;An illustration.&mdash;Volume can be found in scope
better than in suggestion Pages <a href="#Page_87">87</a>-<a href="#Page_115">115</a></p>

<p>JUSTIFICATION OF ART</p>

<p>Art is subject to moral censorship.&mdash;Its initial or specific excellence
is not enough.&mdash;All satisfactions, however hurtful, have an initial
worth.&mdash;But, on the whole, artistic activity is innocent.&mdash;It is
liberal, and typical of perfect activity.&mdash;The ideal, when incarnate,
becomes subject to civil society.&mdash;Plato's strictures: he exaggerates
the effect of myths.&mdash;His deeper moral objections.&mdash;Their
lightness.&mdash;Importance of &aelig;sthetic alternatives.&mdash;The importance of
&aelig;sthetic goods varies with temperaments.&mdash;The &aelig;sthetic temperament
requires tutelage.&mdash;Aesthetic values everywhere interfused.&mdash;They are
primordial.&mdash;To superpose them adventitiously is to destroy them.&mdash;They
flow naturally from perfect function.&mdash;Even inhibited functions, when
they fall into a new rhythm, yield new beauties.&mdash;He who loves beauty
must chasten it Pages <a href="#Page_166">166</a>-<a href="#Page_190">190</a></p>

<p>THE CRITERION OF TASTE</p>

<p>Dogmatism is inevitable but may be enlightened.&mdash;Taste gains in
authority as it is more and more widely based.&mdash;Different &aelig;sthetic
endowments may be compared in quantity or force.&mdash;Authority of vital
over verbal judgments.&mdash;Tastes differ also in purity or
consistency.&mdash;They differ, finally, in pertinence, and in width of
appeal.&mdash;Art may grow classic by idealising the familiar, or by
reporting the ultimate.&mdash;Good taste demands that art should be rational,
<i>i.e.</i>, harmonious with all other interests.&mdash;A mere &quot;work of art&quot; a
baseless artifice.&mdash;Human uses give to works of art their highest
expression and charm.&mdash;The sad values of appearance.&mdash;They need to be
made prophetic of practical goods, which in turn would be suffused with
beauty Pages <a href="#Page_191">191</a>-<a href="#Page_215">215</a></p>

<p>ART AND HAPPINESS</p>

<p>Aesthetic harmonies are parodies of real ones, which in turn would be
suffused with beauty, yet prototypes of true perfections.&mdash;Pros and cons
of detached indulgences.&mdash;The happy imagination is one initially in line
with things, and brought always closer to them by experience.&mdash;Reason is
the principle of both art and happiness.&mdash;Only a rational society can
have sure and perfect arts.&mdash;Why art is now empty and
unstable.&mdash;Anomalous character of the irrational artist.&mdash;True art

<p style='text-align: center;'>THE BASIS OF ART IN INSTINCT AND EXPERIENCE</p>


<div class="sidenote">Man affects his environment, sometimes to good purpose.</div>

<p>Man exists amid a universal ferment of being, and not only needs
plasticity in his habits and pursuits but finds plasticity also in the
surrounding world. Life is an equilibrium which is maintained now by
accepting modification and now by imposing it. Since the organ for all
activity is a body in mechanical relation to other material objects,
objects which the creature's instincts often compel him to appropriate
or transform, changes in his habits and pursuits leave their mark on
whatever he touches. His habitat must needs bear many a trace of his
presence, from which intelligent observers might infer something about
his life and action. These vestiges of action are for the most part
imprinted unconsciously and aimlessly on the world. They are in
themselves generally useless, like footprints; and yet almost any sign
of man's passage might, under certain conditions, interest a man. A
footprint could fill Robinson Crusoe with emotion, the devastation
wrought by an army's march might prove many <a name="Page_4" id="Page_4" />things to a historian, and
even the disorder in which a room is casually left may express very
vividly the owner's ways and character.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, man's traces are traces of useful action which has
so changed natural objects as to make them congenial to his mind.
Instead of a footprint we might find an arrow; instead of a disordered
room, a well-planted orchard&mdash;things which would not only have betrayed
the agent's habits, but would have served and expressed his intent. Such
propitious forms given by man to matter are no less instrumental in the
Life of Reason than are propitious forms assumed by man's own habit or
fancy. Any operation which thus humanises and rationalises objects is
called art.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Art is plastic instinct conscious of its aim.</div>

<p>All art has an instinctive source and a material embodiment. If the
birds in building nests felt the utility of what they do, they would be
practising an art; and for the instinct to be called rational it would
even suffice that their traditional purpose and method should become
conscious occasionally. Thus weaving is an art, although the weaver may
not be at every moment conscious of its purpose, but may be carried
along, like any other workman, by the routine of his art; and language
is a rational product, not because it always has a use or meaning, but
because it is sometimes felt to have one. Arts are no less automatic
than instincts, and usually, as Aristotle observed, less thoroughly
purpos<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5" />ive; for instincts, being transmitted by inheritance and imbedded
in congenital structure, have to be economically and deeply organised.
If they go far wrong they constitute a burden impossible to throw off
and impossible to bear. The man harassed by inordinate instincts
perishes through want, vice, disease, or madness. Arts, on the contrary,
being transmitted only by imitation and teaching, hover more lightly
over life. If ill-adjusted they make less havoc and cause less drain.
The more superficial they are and the more detached from practical
habits, the more extravagant and meaningless they can dare to become; so
that the higher products of life are the most often gratuitous. No
instinct or institution was ever so absurd as is a large part of human
poetry and philosophy, while the margin of ineptitude is much broader in
religious myth than in religious ethics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is automatic.</div>

<p>Arts are instincts bred and reared in the open, creative habits acquired
in the light of reason. Consciousness accompanies their formation; a
certain uneasiness or desire and a more or less definite conception of
what is wanted often precedes their full organisation. That the need
should be felt before the means for satisfying it have been found has
led the unreflecting to imagine that in art the need produces the
discovery and the idea the work. Causes at best are lightly assigned by
mortals, and this particular superstition is no worse than any other.
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6" />The data&mdash;the plan and its execution&mdash;as conjoined empirically in the
few interesting cases which show successful achievement, are made into a
law, in oblivion of the fact that in more numerous cases such
conjunction fails wholly or in part, and that even in the successful
cases other natural conditions are present, and must be present, to
secure the result. In a matter where custom is so ingrained and
supported by a constant apperceptive illusion, there is little hope of
making thought suddenly exact, or exact language not paradoxical. We
must observe, however, that only by virtue of a false perspective do
ideas seems to govern action, or is a felt necessity the mother of
invention. In truth invention is the child of abundance, and the genius
or vital premonition and groping which achieve art, simultaneously
achieve the ideas which that art embodies; or, rather, ideas are
themselves products of an inner movement which has an automatic
extension outwards; and this extension manifests the ideas. Mere craving
has no lights of its own to prophesy by, no prescience of what the world
may contain that would satisfy, no power of imagining what would allay
its unrest. Images and satisfactions have to come of themselves; then
the blind craving, as it turns into an incipient pleasure, first
recognises its object. The pure will's impotence is absolute, and it
would writhe for ever and consume itself in darkness if perception gave
it no light and experience no premonition.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7" />So are the ideas it expresses.</div>

<p>Now, a man cannot draw bodily from external perception the ideas he is
supposed to create or invent; and as his will or uneasiness, before he
creates the satisfying ideas, is by hypothesis without them, it follows
that creation or invention is automatic. The ideas come of themselves,
being new and unthought-of figments, similar, no doubt, to old
perceptions and compacted of familiar materials, but reproduced in a
novel fashion and dropping in their sudden form from the blue. However
instantly they may be welcomed, they were not already known and never
could have been summoned. In the stock example, for instance, of groping
for a forgotten name, we know the context in which that name should lie;
we feel the environment of our local void; but what finally pops into
that place, reinstated there by the surrounding tensions, is itself
unforeseen, for it was just this that was forgotten. Could we have
invoked the name we should not have needed to do so, having it already
at our disposal. It is in fact a palpable impossibility that any idea
should call itself into being, or that any act or any preference should
be its own ground. The responsibility assumed for these things is not a
determination to conceive them before they are conceived (which is a
contradiction in terms) but an embrace and appropriation of them once
they have appeared. It is thus that ebullitions in parts of our nature
become touchstones for the whole; and the inci<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8" />dents within us seem
hardly our own work till they are accepted and incorporated into the
main current of our being. All invention is tentative, all art
experimental, and to be sought, like salvation, with fear and trembling.
There is a painful pregnancy in genius, a long incubation and waiting
for the spirit, a thousand rejections and futile birth-pangs, before the
wonderful child appears, a gift of the gods, utterly undeserved and
inexplicably perfect. Even this unaccountable success comes only in rare
and fortunate instances. What is ordinarily produced is so base a
hybrid, so lame and ridiculous a changeling, that we reconcile ourselves
with difficulty to our offspring and blush to be represented by our
fated works.</p>

<div class="sidenote">We are said to control whatever obeys us.</div>

<p>The propensity to attribute happy events to our own agency, little as we
understand what we mean by it, and to attribute only untoward results to
external forces, has its ground in the primitive nexus of experience.
What we call ourselves is a certain cycle of vegetative processes,
bringing a round of familiar impulses and ideas; this stream has a
general direction, a conscious vital inertia, in harmony with which it
moves. Many of the developments within it are dialectical; that is, they
go forward by inner necessity, like an egg hatching within its shell,
warmed but undisturbed by an environment of which they are wholly
oblivious; and this sort of growth, when there is adequate consciousness
of it, is felt to be both absolutely obvious and abso<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9" />lutely free. The
emotion that accompanies it is pleasurable, but is too active and proud
to call itself a pleasure; it has rather the quality of assurance and
right. This part of life, however, is only its courageous core; about it
play all sorts of incidental processes, allying themselves to it in more
or less congruous movement. Whatever peripheral events fall in with the
central impulse are accordingly lost in its energy and felt to be not so
much peripheral and accidental as inwardly grounded, being, like the
stages of a prosperous dialectic, spontaneously demanded and instantly
justified when they come.</p>

<p>The sphere of the self's power is accordingly, for primitive
consciousness, simply the sphere of what happens well; it is the entire
unoffending and obedient part of the world. A man who has good luck at
dice prides himself upon it, and believes that to have it is his destiny
and desert. If his luck were absolutely constant, he would say he had
the <i>power</i> to throw high; and as the event would, by hypothesis,
sustain his boast, there would be no practical error in that assumption.
A will that never found anything to thwart it would think itself
omnipotent; and as the psychological essence of omniscience is not to
suspect there is anything which you do not know, so the psychological
essence of omnipotence is not to suspect that anything can happen which
you do not desire. Such claims would undoubtedly be made if experience
lent them the least colour; but would even <a name="Page_10" id="Page_10" />the most comfortable and
innocent assurances of this sort cease to be precarious? Might not any
moment of eternity bring the unimagined contradiction, and shake the
dreaming god?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Utility is a result.</div>

<p>Utility, like significance, is an eventual harmony in the arts and by no
means their ground. All useful things have been discovered as the
Lilliputians discovered roast pig; and the casual feat has furthermore
to be supported by a situation favourable to maintaining the art. The
most useful act will never be repeated unless its secret remains
embodied in structure. Practice and endeavour will not help an artist to
remain long at his best; and many a performance is applauded which
cannot be imitated. To create the requisite structure two preformed
structures are needed: one in the agent, to give him skill and
perseverance, and another in the material, to give it the right
plasticity. Human progress would long ago have reached its goal if every
man who recognised a good could at once appropriate it, and possess
wisdom for ever by virtue of one moment's insight. Insight,
unfortunately, is in itself perfectly useless and inconsequential; it
can neither have produced its own occasion nor now insure its own
recurrence. Nevertheless, being proof positive that whatever basis it
needs is actual, insight is also an indication that the extant
structure, if circumstances maintain it, may continue to operate with
the <a name="Page_11" id="Page_11" />same moral results, maintaining the vision which it has once
supported.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The useful naturally stable.</div>

<p>When men find that by chance they have started a useful change in the
world, they congratulate themselves upon it and call their persistence
in that practice a free activity. And the activity is indeed rational,
since it subserves an end. The happy organisation which enables us to
continue in that rational course is the very organisation which enabled
us to initiate it. If this new process was formed under external
influences, the same influences, when they operate again, will
reconstitute the process each time more easily; while if it was formed
quite spontaneously, its own inertia will maintain it quietly in the
brain and bring it to the surface whenever circumstances permit. This is
what is called learning by experience. Such lessons are far from
indelible and are not always at command. Yet what has once been done may
be repeated; repetition reinforces itself and becomes habit; and a clear
memory of the benefit once attained by fortunate action, representing as
it does the trace left by that action in the system, and its harmony
with the man's usual impulses (for the action is felt to be
<i>beneficial</i>), constitutes a strong presumption that the act will be
repeated automatically on occasion; <i>i.e.</i>, that it has really been
learned. Consciousness, which willingly attends to results only, will
judge either the memory or the benefit, or both confusedly, to be the
ground of this readi<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12" />ness to act; and only if some hitch occurs in the
machinery, so that rational behaviour fails to takes place, will a
surprised appeal be made to material accidents, or to a guilty
forgetfulness or indocility in the soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intelligence is docility.</div>

<p>The idiot cannot learn from experience at all, because a new process, in
his liquid brain, does not modify structure; while the fool uses what he
has learned only inaptly and in frivolous fragments, because his
stretches of linked experience are short and their connections insecure.
But when the cerebral plasm is fresh and well disposed and when the
paths are clear, attention is consecutive and learning easy; a multitude
of details can be gathered into a single cycle of memory or of potential
regard. Under such circumstances action is the unimpeded expression of
healthy instinct in an environment squarely faced. Conduct from the
first then issues in progress, and, by reinforcing its own organisation
at each rehearsal, makes progress continual. For there will subsist not
only a readiness to act and a great precision in action, but if any
significant circumstance has varied in the conditions or in the
interests at stake, this change will make itself felt; it will check the
process and prevent precipitate action. Deliberation or well-founded
scruple has the same source as facility&mdash;a plastic and quick
organisation. To be sensitive to difficulties and dangers goes with
being sensitive to opportunities.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" />Art is reason propagating itself.</div>

<p>Of all reason's embodiments art is therefore the most splendid and
complete. Merely to attain categories by which inner experience may be
articulated, or to feign analogies by which a universe may be conceived,
would be but a visionary triumph if it remained ineffectual and went
with no actual remodelling of the outer world, to render man's dwelling
more appropriate and his mind better fed and more largely transmissible.
Mind grows self-perpetuating only by its expression in matter. What
makes progress possible is that rational action may leave traces in
nature, such that nature in consequence furnishes a better basis for the
Life of Reason; in other words progress is art bettering the conditions
of existence. Until art arises, all achievement is internal to the
brain, dies with the individual, and even in him spends itself without
recovery, like music heard in a dream. Art, in establishing instruments
for human life beyond the human body, and moulding outer things into
sympathy with inner values, establishes a ground whence values may
continually spring up; the thatch that protects from to-day's rain will
last and keep out to-morrow's rain also; the sign that once expresses an
idea will serve to recall it in future.</p>

<p>Not only does the work of art thus perpetuate its own function and
produce a better experience, but the process of art also perpetuates
itself, because it is teachable. Every animal learns <a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" />something by
living; but if his offspring inherit only what he possessed at birth,
they have to learn life's lessons over again from the beginning, with at
best some vague help given by their parents' example. But when the
fruits of experience exist in the common environment, when new
instruments, unknown to nature, are offered to each individual for his
better equipment, although he must still learn for himself how to live,
he may learn in a humaner school, where artificial occasions are
constantly open to him for expanding his powers. It is no longer merely
hidden inner processes that he must reproduce to attain his
predecessors' wisdom; he may acquire much of it more expeditiously by
imitating their outward habit&mdash;an imitation which, furthermore, they
have some means of exacting from him. Wherever there is art there is a
possibility of training. A father who calls his idle sons from the
jungle to help him hold the plough, not only inures them to labour but
compels them to observe the earth upturned and refreshed, and to watch
the germination there; their wandering thought, their incipient
rebellions, will be met by the hope of harvest; and it will not be
impossible for them, when their father is dead, to follow the plough of
their own initiative and for their own children's sake. So great is the
sustained advance in rationality made possible by art which, being
embodied in matter, is teachable and transmissible by training; for in
art the values secured are recognised the more <a name="Page_15" id="Page_15" />easily for having been
first enjoyed when other people furnished the means to them; while the
maintenance of these values is facilitated by an external tradition
imposing itself contagiously or by force on each new generation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beauty an incident in rational art.</div>

<p>Art is action which transcending the body makes the world a more
congenial stimulus to the soul. All art is therefore useful and
practical, and the notable &aelig;sthetic value which some works of art
possess, for reasons flowing for the most part out of their moral
significance, is itself one of the satisfactions which art offers to
human nature as a whole. Between sensation and abstract discourse lies a
region of deployed sensibility or synthetic representation, a region
where more is seen at arm's length than in any one moment could be felt
at close quarters, and yet where the remote parts of experience, which
discourse reaches only through symbols, are recovered and recomposed in
something like their native colours and experienced relations. This
region, called imagination, has pleasures more airy and luminous than
those of sense, more massive and rapturous than those of intelligence.
The values inherent in imagination, in instant intuition, in sense
endowed with form, are called &aelig;sthetic values; they are found mainly in
nature and living beings, but often also in man's artificial works, in
images evoked by language, and in the realm of sound.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inseparable from the others.</div>

<p>Productions in which an &aelig;sthetic value is or is <a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" />supposed to be
prominent take the name of fine art; but the work of fine art so defined
is almost always an abstraction from the actual object, which has many
non-&aelig;sthetic functions and values. To separate the &aelig;sthetic element,
abstract and dependent as it often is, is an artifice which is more
misleading than helpful; for neither in the history of art nor in a
rational estimate of its value can the &aelig;sthetic function of things be
divorced from the practical and moral. What had to be done was, by
imaginative races, done imaginatively; what had to be spoken or made,
was spoken or made fitly, lovingly, beautifully. Or, to take the matter
up on its psychological side, the ceaseless experimentation and ferment
of ideas, in breeding what it had a propensity to breed, came sometimes
on figments that gave it delightful pause; these beauties were the first
knowledges and these arrests the first hints of real and useful things.
The rose's grace could more easily be plucked from its petals than the
beauty of art from its subject, occasion, and use. An &aelig;sthetic
fragrance, indeed, all things may have, if in soliciting man's senses or
reason they can awaken his imagination as well; but this middle zone is
so mixed and nebulous, and its limits are so vague, that it cannot well
be treated in theory otherwise than as it exists in fact&mdash;as a phase of
man's sympathy with the world he moves in. If art is that element in the
Life of Reason which consists in modifying its environment the <a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" />better
to attain its end, art may be expected to subserve all parts of the
human ideal, to increase man's comfort, knowledge, and delight. And as
nature, in her measure, is wont to satisfy these interests together, so
art, in seeking to increase that satisfaction, will work simultaneously
in every ideal direction. Nor will any of these directions be on the
whole good, or tempt a well-trained will, if it leads to estrangement
from all other interests. The &aelig;sthetic good will be accordingly hatched
in the same nest with the others, and incapable of flying far in a
different air.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>RATIONALITY OF INDUSTRIAL ART</p>


<div class="sidenote">Utility is ultimately ideal.</div>

<p>If there were anything wholly instrumental or merely useful its
rationality, such as it was, would be perfectly obvious. Such a thing
would be exhaustively defined by its result and conditioned exclusively
by its expediency. Yet the value of most human arts, mechanical as they
may appear, has a somewhat doubtful and mixed character. Naval
architecture, for instance, serves a clear immediate purpose. Yet to
cross the sea is not an ultimate good, and the ambition or curiosity
that first led man, being a land-animal, to that now vulgar adventure,
has sometimes found moralists to condemn it. A vessel's true excellence
is more deeply conditioned than the ship-wright may imagine when he
prides himself on having made something that will float and go. The best
battle-ship, or racing yacht, or freight steamer, might turn out to be a
worse thing for its specific excellence, if the action it facilitated
proved on the whole maleficent, and if war or racing or trade could be
rightly condemned by a philosopher. The rationality of ship-building has
several sets of conditions: the <a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" />patron's demands must be first
fulfilled; then the patron's specifications have to be judged by the
purpose he in turn has in mind; this purpose itself has to be justified
by his ideal in life, and finally his ideal by its adequacy to his total
or ultimate nature. Error on any of these planes makes the ultimate
product irrational; and if a finer instinct, even in the midst of
absorbing subsidiary action, warns a man that he is working against his
highest good, his art will lose its savour and its most skilful products
will grow hateful, even to his immediate apprehension, infected as they
will be by the canker of folly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Work wasted and chances missed.</div>

<p>Art thus has its casuistry no less than morals, and philosophers in the
future, if man should at last have ceased to battle with ghosts, might
be called upon to review material civilisation from its beginnings,
testing each complication by its known ultimate fruits and reaching in
this way a purified and organic ideal of human industry, an ideal which
education and political action might help to embody. If nakedness or a
single garment were shown to be wholesomer and more agreeable than
complicated clothes, weavers and tailors might be notably diminished in
number. If, in another quarter, popular fancy should sicken at last of
its traditional round of games and fictions, it might discover infinite
entertainment in the play of reality and truth, and infinite novelties
to be created by fruitful labour; so that many a pleasure might be found
which <a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" />is now clogged by mere apathy and unintelligence. Human genius,
like a foolish Endymion, lies fast asleep amid its opportunities,
wasting itself in dreams and disinheriting itself by negligence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ideals must be interpreted, not prescribed.</div>

<p>Descriptive economy, however, will have to make great progress before
the concrete ethics of art can be properly composed. History, conceived
hitherto as a barbarous romance, does not furnish sufficient data by
which the happiness of life under various conditions may be soberly
estimated. Politics has receded into the region of blind impulse and
factional interests, and would need to be reconstituted before it could
approach again that scientific problem which Socrates and his great
disciples would have wished it to solve. Meantime it may not be
premature to say something about another factor in practical philosophy,
namely, the ultimate interests by which industrial arts and their
products have to be estimated. Even before we know the exact effects of
an institution we can fix to some extent the purposes which, in order to
be beneficent, it will have to subserve, although in truth such
antecedent fixing of aims cannot go far, seeing that every operation
reacts on the organ that executes it, thereby modifying the ideal
involved. Doubtless the most industrial people would still wish to be
happy and might accordingly lay down certain principles which its
industry should never transgress, as for instance that production should
at any price leave room for lib<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21" />erty, leisure, beauty, and a spirit of
general co-operation and goodwill. But a people once having become
industrial will hardly be happy if sent back to Arcadia; it will have
formed busy habits which it cannot relax without tedium; it will have
developed a restlessness and avidity which will crave matter, like any
other kind of hunger. Every experiment in living qualifies the initial
possibilities of life, and the moralist would reckon without his host if
he did not allow for the change which forced exercise makes in instinct,
adjusting it more or less to extant conditions originally, perhaps,
unwelcome. It is too late for the highest good to prescribe flying for
quadrupeds or peace for the sea waves.</p>

<p>What antecedent interest does mechanical art subserve? What is the
initial and commanding ideal of life by which all industrial
developments are to be proved rational or condemned as vain? If we look
to the most sordid and instrumental of industries we see that their
purpose is to produce a foreordained result with the minimum of effort.
They serve, in a word, to cheapen commodities. But the value of such an
achievement is clearly not final; it hangs on two underlying ideals, one
demanding abundance in the things produced and the other diminution in
the toil required to produce them. At least the latter interest may in
turn be analysed further, for to diminish toil is itself no absolute
good; it is a good only when such diminution in one sphere liberates
energies <a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" />which may be employed in other fields, so that the total human
accomplishment may be greater. Doubtless useful labour has its natural
limits, for if overdone any activity may impair the power of enjoying
both its fruits and its operation. Yet in so far as labour can become
spontaneous and in itself delightful it is a positive benefit; and to
its intrinsic value must be added all those possessions or useful
dispositions which it may secure. Thus one ideal&mdash;to diminish
labour&mdash;falls back into the other&mdash;to diffuse occasions for enjoyment.
The aim is not to curtail occupation but rather to render occupation
liberal by supplying it with more appropriate objects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The aim of industry is to live well.</div>

<p>It is then liberal life, fostered by industry and commerce or involved
in them, that alone can justify these instrumental pursuits. Those
philosophers whose ethics is nothing but sentimental physics like to
point out that happiness arises out of work and that compulsory
activities, dutifully performed, underlie freedom. Of course matter or
force underlies everything; but rationality does not accrue to spirit
because mechanism supports it; it accrues to mechanism in so far as
spirit is thereby called into existence; so that while values derive
existence only from their causes, causes derive value only from their
results. Functions cannot be exercised until their organs exist and are
in operation, so that what is primary in the order of genesis is always
last and most dependent in the order <a name="Page_23" id="Page_23" />of worth. The primary substance of
things is their mere material; their first cause is their lowest
instrument. Matter has only the values of the forms which it assumes,
and while each stratification may create some intrinsic ideal and
achieve some good, these goods are dull and fleeting in proportion to
their rudimentary character and their nearness to protoplasmic thrills.
Where reason exists life cannot, indeed, be altogether slavish; for any
operation, however menial and fragmentary, when it is accompanied by
ideal representation of the ends pursued and by felt success in
attaining them, becomes a sample and anagram of all freedom.
Nevertheless to arrest attention on a means is really illiberal, though
not so much by what such an interest contains as by what it ignores.
Happiness in a treadmill is far from inconceivable; but for that
happiness to be rational the wheel should be nothing less than the whole
sky from which influences can descend upon us. There would be meanness
of soul in being content with a smaller sphere, so that not everything
that was relevant to our welfare should be envisaged in our thoughts and
purposes. To be absorbed by the incidental is the animal's portion; to
be confined to the instrumental is the slave's. For though within such
activity there may be a rational movement, the activity ends in a fog
and in mere physical drifting. Happiness has to be begged of fortune or
found in mystical indifference: it is not yet subtended by rational art.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24" />Some arts, but no men, are slaves by nature.</div>

<p>The Aristotelian theory of slavery, in making servile action wholly
subservient, sins indeed against persons, but not against arts. It sins
against persons because there is inconsiderate haste in asserting that
whole classes of men are capable of no activities, except the physical,
which justify themselves inherently. The lower animals also have
physical interests and natural emotions. A man, if he deserves the name,
must be credited with some rational capacity: prospect and retrospect,
hope and the ideal portraiture of things, must to some extent employ
him. Freedom to cultivate these interests is then his inherent right. As
the lion vindicates his prerogative to ferocity and dignity, so every
rational creature vindicates his prerogative to spiritual freedom. But a
too summary classification of individuals covers, in Aristotle, a just
discrimination among the arts. In so far as a man's occupation is merely
instrumental and justified only externally, he is obviously a slave and
his art at best an evil necessity. For the operation is by hypothesis
not its own end; and if the product, needful for some ulterior purpose,
had been found ready made in nature, the other and self-justifying
activities could have gone on unimpeded, without the arrest or
dislocation which is involved in first establishing the needful
conditions for right action. If air had to be manufactured, as dwellings
must be, or breathing to be learned like speech, mankind would start
with an <a name="Page_25" id="Page_25" />even greater handicap and would never have come within sight of
such goals as it can now pursue. Thus all instrumental and remedial
arts, however indispensable, are pure burdens; and progress consists in
abridging them as much as is possible without contracting the basis for
moral life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Servile arts may grow spontaneous or their products may be
renounced.</div>

<p>This needful abridgment can take place in two directions. The art may
become instinctive, unconscious of the utility that backs it and
conscious only of the solicitation that leads it on. In that measure
human nature is adapted to its conditions; lessons long dictated by
experience are actually learned and become hereditary habits. So
inclination to hunt and fondness for nursing children have passed into
instincts in the human race; and what if it were a forced art would be
servile, by becoming spontaneous has risen to be an ingredient in ideal
life; for sport and maternity are human ideals. In an opposite direction
servile arts may be abridged by a lapse of the demand which required
them. The servile art of vine-dressers, for instance, would meet such a
fate if the course of history, instead of tending to make the vintage an
ideal episode and to create worshippers of Bacchus and Priapus, tended
rather to bring about a distaste for wine and made the whole industry
superfluous. This solution is certainly less happy than the other,
insomuch as it suppresses a function instead of taking it up into
organic life; yet life to be organic has to be ex<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" />clusive and finite; it
has to work out specific tendencies in a specific environment; and
therefore to surrender a particular impeded impulse may involve a clear
gain, if only a compensating unimpeded good thereby comes to light
elsewhere. If wine disappeared, with all its humane and symbolic
consecrations, that loss might bring an ultimate gain, could some less
treacherous friend of frankness and merriment be thereby brought into
the world.</p>

<p>In practice servile art is usually mitigated by combining these two
methods; the demand subserved, being but ill supported, learns to
restrain itself and be less importunate; while at the same time habit
renders the labour which was once unwilling largely automatic, and even
overlays it with ideal associations. Human nature is happily elastic;
there is hardly a need that may not be muffled or suspended, and hardly
an employment that may not be relieved by the automatic interest with
which it comes to be pursued. To this automatic interest other
palliatives are often added, sometimes religion, sometimes mere dulness
and resignation; but in these cases the evil imposed is merely
counterbalanced or forgotten, it is not remedied. Reflective and
spiritual races minimise labour by renunciation, for they find it easier
to give up its fruits than to justify its exactions. Among energetic and
self-willed men, on the contrary, the demand for material progress
remains predominant, and philosophy dwells by <a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" />preference on the
possibility that a violent and continual subjection in the present might
issue in a glorious future dominion. This possible result was hardly
realised by the Jews, nor long maintained by the Greeks and Romans, and
it remains to be seen whether modern industrialism can achieve it. In
fact, we may suspect that success only comes when a nation's external
task happens to coincide with its natural genius, so that a minimum of
its labour is servile and a maximum of its play is beneficial. It is in
such cases that we find colossal achievements and apparently
inexhaustible energies. Prosperity is indeed the basis of every ideal
attainment, so that prematurely to recoil from hardship, or to be
habitually conscious of hardship at all, amounts to renouncing
beforehand all earthly goods and all chance of spiritual greatness. Yet
a chance is no certainty. When glory requires Titanic labours it often
finds itself in the end buried under a pyramid rather than raised upon a
pedestal. Energies which are not from the beginning self-justifying and
flooded with light seldom lead to ideal greatness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Art starts from two potentialities: its material and its
problem.</div>

<p>The action to which industry should minister is accordingly liberal or
spontaneous action; and this one condition of rationality in from two
the arts. But a second condition is implicit in the first: freedom means
freedom in some operation, ideality means the ideality of something
embodied and material. Activity, achievement, a <a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" />passage from prospect
to realisation, is evidently essential to life. If all ends were already
reached, and no art were requisite, life could not exist at all, much
less a Life of Reason. No politics, no morals, no thought would be
possible, for all these move towards some ideal and envisage a goal to
which they presently pass. The transition is the activity, without which
achievement would lose its zest and indeed its meaning; for a situation
could never be achieved which had been given from all eternity. The
ideal is a concomitant emanation from the natural and has no other
possible status. Those human possessions which are perennial and of
inalienable value are in a manner potential possessions only. Knowledge,
art, love are always largely in abeyance, while power is absolutely
synonymous with potentiality. Fruition requires a continual recovery, a
repeated re-establishment of the state we enjoy. So breath and
nutrition, feeling and thought, come in pulsations; they have only a
periodic and rhythmic sort of actuality. The operation may be sustained
indefinitely, but only if it admits a certain internal oscillation.</p>

<p>A creature like man, whose mode of being is a life or experience and not
a congealed ideality, such as eternal truth might show, must accordingly
find something to do; he must operate in an environment in which
everything is not already what he is presently to make it. In the actual
world this first condition of life is only too amply fulfilled; the real
difficulty in man's estate, the <a name="Page_29" id="Page_29" />true danger to his vitality, lies not
in want of work but in so colossal a disproportion between demand and
opportunity that the ideal is stunned out of existence and perishes for
want of hope. The Life of Reason is continually beaten back upon its
animal sources, and nations are submerged in deluge after deluge of
barbarism. Impressed as we may well be by this ancient experience, we
should not overlook the complementary truth which under more favourable
circumstances would be as plain as the other: namely, that our deepest
interest is after all to live, and we could not live if all acquisition,
assimilation, government, and creation had been made impossible for us
by their foregone realisation, so that every operation was forestalled
by the given fact. The distinction between the ideal and the real is one
which the human ideal itself insists should be preserved. It is an
essential expression of life, and its disappearance would be tantamount
to death, making an end to voluntary transition and ideal
representation. All objects envisaged either in vulgar action or in the
airiest cognition must be at first ideal and distinct from the given
facts, otherwise action would have lost its function at the same moment
that thought lost its significance. All life would have collapsed into a
purposeless datum.</p>

<p>The ideal requires, then, that opportunities should be offered for
realising it through action, and that transition should be possible to
it from a given state of things. One form of such transi<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" />tion is art,
where the ideal is a possible and more excellent form to be given to
some external substance or medium. Art needs to find a material
relatively formless which its business is to shape; and this initial
formlessness in matter is essential to art's existence. Were there no
stone not yet sculptured and built into walls, no sentiment not yet
perfectly uttered in poetry, no distance or oblivion yet to be abolished
by motion or inferential thought, activity of all sorts would have lost
its occasion. Matter, or actuality in what is only potentially ideal, is
therefore a necessary condition for realising an ideal at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Each must be definite and congruous with the other.</div>

<p>This potentiality, however, in so far as the ideal requires it, is a
quite definite disposition. Absolute chaos would defeat life as surely
as would absolute ideality. Activity, in presupposing material
conditions, presupposes them to be favourable, so that a movement
towards the ideal may actually take place. Matter, which from the point
of view of a given ideal is merely its potentiality, is in itself the
potentiality of every other ideal as well; it is accordingly responsible
to no ideal in particular and proves in some measure refractory to all.
It makes itself felt, either as an opportune material or as an
accidental hindrance, only when it already possesses definite form and
affinities; given in a certain quantity, quality, and order, matter
feeds the specific life which, if given otherwise, it would impede or
smother altogether.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31" />A sophism exposed</div>

<p>Art, in calling for materials, calls for materials plastic to its
influence and definitely predisposed to its ends. Unsuitableness in the
data far from grounding action renders it abortive, and no expedient
could be more sophistical than that into which theodicy, in its
desperate straits, has sometimes been driven, of trying to justify as
conditions for ideal achievement the very conditions which make ideal
achievement impossible. The given state from which transition is to take
place to the ideal must support that transition; so that the desirable
want of ideality which plastic matter should possess is merely relative
and strictly determined. Art and reason find in nature the background
they require; but nature, to be wholly justified by its ideal functions,
would have to subserve them perfectly. It would have to offer to reason
and art a sufficient and favourable basis; it would have to feed sense
with the right stimuli at the right intervals, so that art and reason
might continually flourish and be always moving to some new success. A
poet needs emotions and perceptions to translate into language, since
these are his subject-matter and his inspiration; but starvation,
physical or moral, will not help him to sing. One thing is to meet with
the conditions inherently necessary for a given action; another thing is
to meet with obstacles fatal to the same. A propitious formlessness in
matter is no sort of evil; and evil is so far from being a propitious
formlessness in matter that it is rather <a name="Page_32" id="Page_32" />an impeding form which matter
has already assumed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Industry prepares matter for the liberal arts.</div>

<p>Out of this appears, with sufficient clearness, the rational function
which the arts possess. They give, as nature does, a form to matter, but
they give it a more propitious form. Such success in art is possible
only when the materials and organs at hand are in a large measure
already well disposed; for it can as little exist with a dull organ as
with no organ at all, while there are winds in which every sail must be
furled. Art depends upon profiting by a bonanza and learning to sail in
a good breeze, strong enough for speed and conscious power but placable
enough for dominion and liberty of soul. Then perfection in action can
be attained and a self-justifying energy can emerge out of apathy on the
one hand and out of servile and wasteful work on the other. Art has
accordingly two stages: one mechanical or industrial, in which untoward
matter is better prepared, or impeding media are overcome; the other
liberal, in which perfectly fit matter is appropriated to ideal uses and
endowed with a direct spiritual function. A premonition or rehearsal of
these two stages may be seen in nature, where nutrition and reproduction
fit the body for its ideal functions, whereupon sensation and
cerebration make it a direct organ of mind. Industry merely gives nature
that form which, if more thoroughly humane, she might have originally
possessed for our benefit; liberal arts <a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" />bring to spiritual fruition the
matter which either nature or industry has prepared and rendered
propitious. This spiritual fruition consists in the activity of turning
an apt material into an expressive and delightful form, thus filling the
world with objects which by symbolising ideal energies tend to revive
them under a favouring influence and therefore to strengthen and refine
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Each partakes of the other</div>

<p>It remains merely to note that all industry contains an element of fine
art and all fine art an element of industry; since every proximate end,
in being attained, satisfies the mind and manifests the intent that
pursued it; while every operation upon a material, even one so volatile
as sound, finds that material somewhat refractory. Before the product
can attain its ideal function many obstacles to its transparency and
fitness have to be removed. A certain amount of technical and
instrumental labour is thus involved in every work of genius, and a
certain genius in every technical success.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>EMERGENCE OF FINE ART</p>


<div class="sidenote">Art is spontaneous action made stable by success.</div>

<p>Action which is purely spontaneous is merely tentative. Any experience
of success or utility which might have preceded, if it availed to make
action sure, would avail to make it also intentional and conscious of
its ulterior results. Now the actual issue which an action is destined
to have, since it is something future and problematical, can exert no
influence on its own antecedents; but if any picture of what the issue
is likely to be accompanies the heat and momentum of action, that
picture being, of all antecedents in the operation, the one most easily
remembered and described, may be picked out as essential, and dignified
with the name of motive or cause. This will not happen to every
prophetic idea; we may live in fear and trembling as easily as with an
arrogant consciousness of power. The difference flows from the greater
or lesser affinity that happens to exist between expectation and
instinct. Action remains always, in its initial phase, spontaneous and
automatic; it retains an inwardly grounded and perfectly blind tendency
of its own; but this tend<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" />ency may agree or clash with the motor
impulses subtending whatever ideas may at the same time people the
fancy. If the blind and the ideal impulses agree, spontaneous action is
voluntary and its result intentional; if they clash, the ideas remain
speculative and idle, random, ineffectual wishes; while the result, not
being referable to any idea, is put down to fate. The sense of power,
accordingly, shows either that events have largely satisfied desire, so
that natural tendency goes hand in hand with the suggestions of
experience, or else that experience has not been allowed to count at all
and that the future is being painted <i>a priori</i>. In the latter case the
sense of power is illusory. Action will then never really issue in the
way intended, and even thought will only seem to make progress by
constantly forgetting its original direction.</p>

<p>Though life, however, is initially experimental and always remains
experimental at bottom, yet experiment fortifies certain tendencies and
cancels others, so that a gradual sediment of habit and wisdom is formed
in the stream of time. Action then ceases to be merely tentative and
spontaneous, and becomes art. Foresight begins to accompany practice
and, as we say, to guide it. Purpose thus supervenes on useful impulse,
and conscious expression on self-sustaining automatism. Art lies between
two extremes. On the one side is purely spontaneous fancy, which would
never foresee its own works and scarcely recognise <a name="Page_36" id="Page_36" />or value them after
they had been created, since at the next moment the imaginative current
would as likely as not have faced about and might be making in the
opposite direction; and on the other side is pure utility, which would
deprive the work of all inherent ideality, and render it inexpressive of
anything in man save his necessities. War, for instance, is an art when,
having set itself an ideal end, it devises means of attaining it; but
this ideal end has for its chief basis some failure in politics and
morals. War marks a weakness and disease in human society, and its best
triumphs are glorious evils&mdash;cruel and treacherous remedies, big with
new germs of disease. War is accordingly a servile art and not
essentially liberal; whatever inherent values its exercise may have
would better be realised in another medium. Yet out of the pomp and
circumstance of war fine arts may arise&mdash;music, armoury, heraldry, and
eloquence. So utility leads to art when its vehicle acquires intrinsic
value and becomes expressive. On the other hand, spontaneous action
leads to art when it acquires a rational function. Thus utterance, which
is primarily automatic, becomes the art of speech when it serves to mark
crises in experience, making them more memorable and influential through
their artificial expression; but expression is never art while it
remains expressive to no purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It combines utility and automatism.</div>

<p>A good way of understanding the fine arts would be to study how they
grow, now out of utility, now <a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" />out of automatism. We should thus see
more clearly how they approach their goal, which can be nothing but the
complete superposition of these two characters. If all practice were art
and all art perfect, no action would remain compulsory and not justified
inherently, while no creative impulse would any longer be wasteful or,
like the impulse to thrum, symptomatic merely and irrelevant to
progress. It is by contributing to the Life of Reason and merging into
its substance that art, like religion or science, first becomes worthy
of praise. Each element comes from a different quarter, bringing its
specific excellence and needing its peculiar purification and
enlightenment, by co-ordination with all the others; and this process of
enlightenment and purification is what we call development in each
department. The meanest arts are those which lie near the limit either
of utility or of automatic self-expression. They become nobler and more
rational as their utility is rendered spontaneous or their spontaneity
beneficent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Automatism fundamental and irresponsible.</div>

<p>The spontaneous arts are older than the useful, since man must live and
act before he can devise instruments for living and acting better. Both
the power to construct machines and the end which, to be useful, they
would have to serve, need to be given in initial impulse. There is
accordingly a vast amount of irresponsible play and loose experiment in
art, as in consciousness, before these gropings <a name="Page_38" id="Page_38" />acquire a settled habit
and function, and rationality begins. The farther back we go into
barbarism the more we find life and mind busied with luxuries; and
though these indulgences may repel a cultivated taste and seem in the
end cruel and monotonous, their status is really nearer to that of
religion and spontaneous art than to that of useful art or of science.
Ceremony, for instance, is compulsory in society and sometimes truly
oppressive, yet its root lies in self-expression and in a certain
ascendency of play which drags all life along into conventional channels
originally dug out in irresponsible bursts of action. This occurs
inevitably and according to physical analogies. Bodily organs grow
automatically and become necessary moulds of life. We must either find a
use for them or bear as best we may the idle burden they impose. Of such
burdens the barbarian carries the greatest possible sum; and while he
paints the heavens with his grotesque mythologies, he encumbers earth
with inventions and prescriptions almost as gratuitous. The fiendish
dances and shouts, the cruel initiations, mutilations, and sacrifices in
which savages indulge, are not planned by them deliberately nor
justified in reflection. Men find themselves falling into these
practices, driven by a tradition hardly distinguishable from instinct.
In its periodic fury the spirit hurries them into wars and orgies, quite
as it kindles sudden flaming visions in their brains, habitually so
torpid. The spontaneous is the worst of tyrants, <a name="Page_39" id="Page_39" />for it exercises a
needless and fruitless tyranny in the guise of duty and inspiration.
Without mitigating in the least the subjection to external forces under
which man necessarily labours, it adds a new artificial subjection to
his own false steps and childish errors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is tamed by contact with the world.</div>

<p>This mental vegetation, this fitful nervous groping, is nevertheless a
sign of life, out of which art emerges by discipline and by a gradual
application to real issues. An artist is a dreamer consenting to dream
of the actual world; he is a highly suggestible mind hypnotised by
reality. Even barbaric genius may find points of application in the
world. These points will be more numerous the more open the eyes have
been, the more docile and intelligent the mind is that gathers and
renders back its impressions in a synthetic and ideal form. Intuition
will then represent, at least symbolically, an actual situation. Grimace
and gesture and ceremony will be modified by a sense of their effect;
they will become artful and will transform their automatic
expressiveness into ideal expression. They will become significant of
what it is intended to communicate and important to know; they will have
ceased to be irresponsible exercises and vents for passing feeling, by
which feeling is dissipated, as in tears, without being embodied and
intellectualised, as in a work of art.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dance.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Functions of gesture.</div>

<p>The dance is an early practice that passes after this fashion into an
art. A prancing stallion may <a name="Page_40" id="Page_40" />transfigure his movements more beautifully
than man is capable of doing; for the springs and limits of effect are
throughout mechanical, and man, in more than one respect, would have to
become a centaur before he could rival the horse's prowess. Human
instinct is very imperfect in this direction, and grows less happy the
more artificial society becomes; most dances, even the savage ones, are
somewhat ridiculous. A rudimentary instinct none the less remains, which
not only involves a faculty of heightened and rhythmic motion, but also
assures a direct appreciation of such motion when seen in others. The
conscious agility, <i>fougue</i>, and precision which fill the performer
become contagious and delight the spectator as well. There are indeed
dances so ugly that, like those of contemporary society, they cannot be
enjoyed unless they are shared; they yield pleasures of exercise only,
or at best of movement in unison. But when man was nearer to the animal
and his body and soul were in happier conjunction, when society, too,
was more compulsive over the individual, he could lend himself more
willingly and gracefully to being a figure in the general pageant of the
world. The dance could then detach itself from its early association
with war and courtship and ally itself rather to religion and art. From
being a spontaneous vent for excitement, or a blind means of producing
it, the dance became a form of discipline and conscious social
control&mdash;a cathartic for the soul; and <a name="Page_41" id="Page_41" />this by a quite intelligible
transition. Gesture, of which the dance is merely a pervasive use, is an
incipient action. It is conduct in the groping stage, before it has lit
on its purpose, as can be seen unmistakably in all the gesticulation of
love and defiance. In this way the dance is attached to life initially
by its physiological origin. Being an incipient act, it naturally leads
to its own completion and may arouse in others the beginnings of an
appropriate response. Gesture is only less catching and less eloquent
than action itself. But gesture, while it has this power of suggesting
action and stimulating the response which would be appropriate if the
action took place, may be arrested in the process of execution, since it
is incipient only; it will then have revealed an intention and betrayed
a state of mind. Thus it will have found a function which action itself
can seldom fulfil. When an act is done, indications of what it was to be
are superfluous; but indications of possible acts are in the highest
degree useful and interesting. In this way gesture assumes the r&ocirc;le of
language and becomes a means of rational expression. It remains
suggestive and imitable enough to convey an idea, but not enough to
precipitate a full reaction; it feeds that sphere of merely potential
action which we call thought; it becomes a vehicle for intuition.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, to tread the measures of a sacred dance, to
march with an army, to <a name="Page_42" id="Page_42" />bear one's share in any universal act, fills the
heart with a voluminous silent emotion. The massive suggestion, the
pressure of the ambient will, is out of all proportion to the present
call for action. Infinite resources and definite premonitions are thus
stored up in the soul; and merely to have moved solemnly together is the
best possible preparation for living afterwards, even if apart, in the
consciousness of a general monition and authority.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Automatic music.</div>

<p>Parallel to this is the genesis and destiny of music, an art originally
closely intertwined with the dance. The same explosive forces that
agitate the limbs loosen the voice; hand, foot, and throat mark their
wild rhythm together. Birds probably enjoy the pulsation of their
singing rather than its sound. Even human music is performed long before
it is listened to, and is at first no more an art than sighing. The
original emotions connected with it are felt by participation in the
performance&mdash;a participation which can become ideal only because, at
bottom, it is always actual. The need of exercise and self-expression,
the force of contagion and unison, bears the soul along before an
artistic appreciation of music arises; and we may still observe among
civilised races how music asserts itself without any &aelig;sthetic intent, as
when the pious sing hymns in common, or the sentimental, at sea, cannot
refrain from whining their whole homely repertory in the moonlight. Here
as elsewhere, instinct and habit <a name="Page_43" id="Page_43" />are phases of the same inner
disposition. What has once occurred automatically on a given occasion
will be repeated in much the same form when a similar occasion recurs.
Thus impulse, reinforced by its own remembered expression, passes into
convention. Savages have a music singularly monotonous, automatic, and
impersonal; they cannot resist the indulgence, though they probably have
little pleasure in it. The same thing happens with customary sounds as
with other prescribed ceremonies; to omit them would be shocking and
well-nigh impossible, yet to repeat them serves no end further than to
avoid a sense of strangeness or inhibition. These automatisms, however,
in working themselves out, are not without certain retroactive effects:
they leave the system exhausted or relieved, and they have meantime
played more or less agreeably on the senses. The music we make
automatically we cannot help hearing incidentally; the sensation may
even modify the expression, since sensation too has its physical side.
The expression is reined in and kept from becoming vagrant, in
proportion as its form and occasion are remembered. The automatic
performer, being henceforth controlled more or less by reflection and
criticism, becomes something of an artist: he trains himself to be
consecutive, impressive, agreeable; he begins to compare his
improvisation with its subject and function, and thus he develops what
is called style and taste.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>MUSIC</p>


<div class="sidenote">Music is a world apart.</div>

<p>Sound readily acquires ideal values. It has power in itself to engross
attention and at the same time may be easily diversified, so as to
become a symbol for other things. Its direct empire is to be compared
with that of stimulants and opiates, yet it presents to the mind, as
these do not, a perception that corresponds, part by part, with the
external stimulus. To hear is almost to understand. The process we
undergo in mathematical or dialectical thinking is called understanding,
because a natural sequence is there adequately translated into ideal
terms. Logical connections seem to be internally justified, while only
the fact that we perceive them here and now, with more or less facility,
is attributed to brute causes. Sound approaches this sort of ideality;
it presents to sense something like the efficacious structure of the
object. It is almost mathematical; but like mathematics it is adequate
only by being abstract; and while it discloses point by point one strain
in existence, it leaves many other strains, which in fact are interwoven
with it, wholly out of account. Music is accordingly, like <a name="Page_45" id="Page_45" />mathematics,
very nearly a world by itself; it contains a whole gamut of experience,
from sensuous elements to ultimate intellectual harmonies. Yet this
second existence, this life in music, is no mere ghost of the other; it
has its own excitements, its quivering alternatives, its surprising
turns; the abstract energy of it takes on so much body, that in
progression or declension it seems quite as impassioned as any animal
triumph or any moral drama.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It justifies itself.</div>

<p>That a pattering of sounds on the ear should have such moment is a fact
calculated to give pause to those philosophers who attempt to explain
consciousness by its utility, or who wish to make physical and moral
processes march side by side from all eternity. Music is essentially
useless, as life is: but both have an ideal extension which lends
utility to its conditions. That the way in which idle sounds run
together should matter so much is a mystery of the same order as the
spirit's concern to keep a particular body alive, or to propagate its
life. Such an interest is, from an absolute point of view, wholly
gratuitous; and so long as the natural basis and expressive function of
spirit are not perceived, this mystery is baffling. In truth the order
of values inverts that of causes; and experience, in which all values
lie, is an ideal resultant, itself ineffectual, of the potencies it can
conceive. Delight in music is liberal; it makes useful the organs and
processes that subserve it. These agencies, <a name="Page_46" id="Page_46" />when they support a
conscious interest in their operation, give that operation its first
glimmering justification, and admit it to the rational sphere. Just so
when organic bodies generate a will bent on their preservation, they add
a value and a moral function to their equilibrium. In vain should we ask
for what purpose existences arise, or become important; that purpose, to
be such, must already have been important to some existence; and the
only question that can be asked or answered is what recognised
importance, what ideal values, actual existences involve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is vital and transient.</div>

<p>We happen to breathe, and on that account are interested in breathing;
and it is no greater marvel that, happening to be subject to intricate
musical sensations, we should be in earnest about these too. The human
ear discriminates sounds with ease; what it hears is so diversified that
its elements can be massed without being confused, or can form a
sequence having a character of its own, to be appreciated and
remembered. The eye too has a field in which clear distinctions and
relations appear, and for that reason is an organ favourable to
intelligence; but what gives music its superior emotional power is its
rhythmic advance. Time is a medium which appeals more than space to
emotion. Since life is itself a flux, and thought an operation, there is
naturally something immediate and breathless about whatever flows and
expands. The visible world offers itself to our regard with <a name="Page_47" id="Page_47" />a certain
lazy indifference. &quot;Peruse me,&quot; it seems to say, &quot;if you will. I am
here; and even if you pass me by now and later find it to your advantage
to resurvey me, I may still be here.&quot; The world of sound speaks a more
urgent language. It insinuates itself into our very substance, and it is
not so much the music that moves us as we that move with it. Its rhythms
seize upon our bodily life, to accelerate or to deepen it; and we must
either become inattentive altogether or remain enslaved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its physical affinities.</div>

<p>This imperious function in music has lent it functions which are far
from &aelig;sthetic. Song can be used to keep in unison many men's efforts, as
when sailors sing as they heave; it can make persuasive and obvious
sentiments which, if not set to music, might seem absurd, as often in
love songs and in psalmody. It may indeed serve to prepare the mind for
any impression whatever, and render the same more intense when it comes.
Music was long used before it was loved or people took pains to refine
it. It would have seemed as strange in primitive times to turn utterance
into a fine art as now to make &aelig;sthetic paces out of mourning or
child-birth. Primitive music is indeed a wail and a parturition; magical
and suggestive as it may be, for long ages it never bethinks itself to
be beautiful. It is content to furnish a contagious melancholy
employment to souls without a language and with little interest in the
real world. Bar<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" />baric musicians, singing and playing together more or
less at random, are too much carried away by their performance to
conceive its effect; they cry far too loud and too unceasingly to
listen. A contagious tradition carries them along and controls them, in
a way, as they improvise; the assembly is hardly an audience; all are
performers, and the crowd is only a stimulus that keeps every one
dancing and howling in emulation. This unconsidered flow of early art
remains present, more or less, to the end. Instead of vague custom we
have schools, and instead of swaying multitudes academic example; but
many a discord and mannerism survive simply because the musician is so
suggestible, or so lost in the tumult of production, as never to
reconsider what he does, or to perceive its wastefulness.</p>

<p>Nevertheless an inherent value exists in all emitted sounds, although
barbaric practice and theory are slow to recognise it. Each tone has its
quality, like jewels of different water; every cadence has its vital
expression, no less inherent in it than that which comes in a posture or
in a thought. Everything audible thrills merely by sounding, and though
this perceptual thrill be at first overpowered by the effort and
excitement of action, yet it eventually fights its way to the top.
Participation in music may become perfunctory or dull for the great
majority, as when hymns are sung in church; a mere suggestion of action
will doubtless continue to colour the impression re<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49" />ceived, for a
tendency to act is involved in perception; but this suggestion will be
only an over-tone or echo behind an auditory feeling. Some performers
will be singled out from the crowd; those whom the public likes to hear
will be asked to continue alone; and soon a certain suasion will be
exerted over them by the approval or censure of others, so that
consciously or unconsciously they will train themselves to please.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physiology of music.</div>

<p>The musical quality of sounds has a simple physical measure for its
basis; and the rate of vibration is complicated by its sweep or
loudness, and by concomitant sounds. What a rich note is to a pure and
thin one, that a chord is to a note; nor is melody wholly different in
principle, for it is a chord rendered piece-meal. Time intervenes, and
the harmony is deployed; so that in melody rhythm is added, with its
immense appeal, to the cumulative effect already secured by rendering
many notes together. The heightened effect which a note gets by figuring
in a phrase, or a phrase in a longer passage, comes of course from the
tensions established and surviving in the sensorium&mdash;a case, differently
shaded, of chords and overtones. The difference is only that the more
emphatic parts of the melody survive clearly to the end, while the
detail, which if perceived might now clash, is largely lost, and out of
the preceding parts perhaps nothing but a certain swing and potency is
present at the close. The mind has been raked and set <a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" />vibrating in an
unusual fashion, so that the <i>finale</i> comes like a fulfilment after much
premonition and desire, whereas the same event, unprepared for, might
hardly have been observed. The whole technique of music is but an
immense elaboration of this principle. It deploys a sensuous harmony by
a sort of dialectic, suspending and resolving it, so that the parts
become distinct and their relation vital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Limits of musical sensibility.</div>

<p>Such elaboration often exceeds the synthetic power of all but the best
trained minds. Both in scope and in articulation musical faculty varies
prodigiously. There is no fixed limit to the power of sustaining a given
conscious process while new features appear in the same field; nor is
there any fixed limit to the power of recovering, under changed
circumstances, a process that was formerly suspended. A whole symphony
might be felt at once, if the musician's power of sustained or
cumulative hearing could stretch so far. As we all survey two notes and
their interval in one sensation (actual experience being always
transitive and pregnant, and its terms ideal), so a trained mind might
survey a whole composition. This is not to say that time would be
transcended in such an experience; the apperception would still have
duration and the object would still have successive features, for
evidently music not arranged in time would not be music, while all
sensations with a recognisable character occupy more than an instant in
passing. <a name="Page_51" id="Page_51" />But the passing sensation, throughout its lapse, presents some
experience; and this experience, taken at any point, may present a
temporal sequence with any number of members, according to the synthetic
and analytic power exerted by the given mind. What is tedious and
formless to the inattentive may seem a perfect whole to one who, as they
say, takes it all in; and similarly what is a frightful deafening
discord to a sense incapable of discrimination, for one who can hear the
parts may break into a celestial chorus. A musical education is
necessary for musical judgment. What most people relish is hardly music;
it is rather a drowsy revery relieved by nervous thrills.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The value of music is relative to them.</div>

<p>The degree to which music should be elaborated depends on the capacity
possessed by those it addresses. There are limits to every man's
synthetic powers, and to stretch those powers to their limit is
exhausting. Excitement then becomes a debauch; it leaves the soul less
capable of habitual harmony. Especially is such extreme tension
disastrous when, as in music, nothing remains to be the fruit of that
mighty victory; the most pregnant revelation sinks to an illusion and is
discredited when it cannot maintain its inspiration in the world's
presence. Everything has its own value and sets up its price; but others
must judge if that price is fair, and sociability is the condition of
all rational excellence. There is therefore a limit to right complexity
in music, a limit set not by the <a name="Page_52" id="Page_52" />nature of music itself, but by its
place in human economy. This limit, though clear in principle, is
altogether variable in practice; duly cultivated people will naturally
place it higher than the unmusical would. In other words, popular music
needs to be simple, although elaborate music may be beautiful to the
few. When elaborate music is the fashion among people to whom all music
is a voluptuous mystery, we may be sure that what they love is
voluptuousness or fashion, and not music itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wonders of musical structure.</div>

<p>Beneath its hypnotic power music, for the musician, has an intellectual
essence. Out of simple chords and melodies, which at first catch only
the ear, he weaves elaborate compositions that by their form appeal also
to the mind. This side of music resembles a richer versification; it may
be compared also to mathematics or to arabesques. A moving arabesque
that has a vital dimension, an audible mathematics, adding sense to
form, and a versification that, since it has no subject-matter, cannot
do violence to it by its complex artifices&mdash;these are types of pure
living, altogether joyful and delightful things. They combine life with
order, precision with spontaneity; the flux in them has become
rhythmical and its freedom has passed into a rational choice, since it
has come in sight of the eternal form it would embody. The musician,
like an architect or goldsmith working in sound, but freer than they
from material trammels, can <a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" />expand for ever his yielding labyrinth;
every step opens up new vistas, every decision&mdash;how unlike those made in
real life!&mdash;multiplies opportunities, and widens the horizon before him,
without preventing him from going back at will to begin afresh at any
point, to trace the other possible paths leading thence through various
magic landscapes. Pure music is pure art. Its extreme abstraction is
balanced by its entire spontaneity, and, while it has no external
significance, it bears no internal curse. It is something to which a few
spirits may well surrender themselves, sure that in a liberal
commonwealth they will be thanked for their ideal labour, the fruits of
which many may enjoy. Such excursions into ultra-mundane regions, where
order is free, refine the mind and make it familiar with perfection. By
analogy an ideal form comes to be conceived and desiderated in other
regions, where it is not produced so readily, and the music heard, as
the Pythagoreans hoped, makes the soul also musical.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its inherent emotions.</div>

<p>It must be confessed, however, that a world of sounds and rhythms, all
about nothing, is a by-world and a mere distraction for a political
animal. Its substance is air, though the spell of it may have moral
affinities. Nevertheless this ethereal art may be enticed to earth and
married with what is mortal. Music interests humanity most when it is
wedded to human events. The alliance comes about through the emotions
which music and life arouse in common. For sound, in sweeping through
the <a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" />body and making felt there its kinetic and potential stress,
provokes no less interest than does any other physical event or
premonition. Music can produce emotion as directly as can fighting or
love. If in the latter instances the body's whole life may be in
jeopardy, this fact is no explanation of our concern; for many a danger
is not felt and there is no magic in the body's future condition, that
it should now affect the soul. What touches the soul is the body's
condition at the moment; and this is altered no less truly by a musical
impression than by some protective or reproductive act. If emotions
accompany the latter, they might as well accompany the former; and in
fact they do. Nor is music the only idle cerebral commotion that enlists
attention and presents issues no less momentous for being quite
imaginary; dreams do the same, and seldom can the real crises of life so
absorb the soul, or prompt it to such extreme efforts, as can delirium
in sickness, or delusion in what passes for health.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In growing specific they remain unearthly.</div>

<p>There is perhaps no emotion incident to human life that music cannot
render in its abstract medium by suggesting the pang of it; though of
course music cannot describe the complex situation which lends earthly
passions their specific colour. It is by fusion with many suggested
emotions that sentiment grows definite; this fusion can hardly come
about without ideas intervening, and certainly it could never be
sustained or expressed without them. Occasions define feelings; <a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" />we can
convey a delicate emotion only by delicately describing the situation
which brings it on. Music, with its irrelevant medium, can never do this
for common life, and the passions, as music renders them, are always
general. But music has its own substitute for conceptual distinctness.
It makes feeling specific, nay, more delicate and precise than
association with things could make it, by uniting it with musical form.
We may say that besides suggesting abstractly all ordinary passions,
music creates a new realm of form far more subtly impassioned than is
vulgar experience. Human life is confined to a dramatic repertory which
has already become somewhat classical and worn, but music has no end of
new situations, shaded in infinite ways; it moves in all sorts of bodies
to all sorts of adventures. In life the ordinary routine of destiny
beats so emphatic a measure that it does not allow free play to feeling;
we cannot linger on anything long enough to exhaust its meaning, nor can
we wander far from the beaten path to catch new impressions. But in
music there are no mortal obligations, no imperious needs calling us
back to reality. Here nothing beautiful is extravagant, nothing
delightful unworthy. Musical refinement finds no limit but its own
instinct, so that a thousand shades of what, in our blundering words, we
must call sadness or mirth, find in music their distinct expression.
Each phrase, each composi<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56" />tion, articulates perfectly what no human
situation could embody. These fine emotions are really new; they are
altogether musical and unexampled in practical life; they are native to
the passing cadence, absolute postures into which it throws the soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They merge with common emotions, and express such as find no
object in nature.</div>

<p>There is enough likeness, however, between musical and mundane feeling
for the first to be used in entertaining the second. Hence the singular
privilege of this art: to give form to what is naturally inarticulate
and express those depths of human nature which can speak no language
current in the world. Emotion is primarily about nothing, and much of it
remains about nothing to the end. What rescues a part of our passions
from this pathological plight, and gives them some other function than
merely to be, is the ideal relevance, the practical and mutually
representative character, which they sometimes acquire. All experience
is pathological if we consider its ground; but a part of it is also
rational if we consider its import. The words I am now writing have a
meaning not because at this moment they are fused together in my animal
soul as a dream might fuse them, however incongruous the situation they
depict might be in waking life; they are significant only if this
moment's product can meet and conspire with some other thought speaking
of what elsewhere exists, and uttering an intuition that from time to
time may be actually <a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" />recovered. The art of distributing interest among
the occasions and vistas of life so as to lend them a constant worth,
and at the same time to give feeling an ideal object, is at bottom the
sole business of education; but the undertaking is long, and much
feeling remains unemployed and unaccounted for. This objectless emotion
chokes the heart with its dull importunity; now it impedes right action,
now it feeds and fattens illusion. Much of it radiates from primary
functions which, though their operation is half known, have only base or
pitiful associations in human life; so that they trouble us with deep
and subtle cravings, the unclaimed <i>Hinterland</i> of life. When music,
either by verbal indications or by sensuous affinities, or by both at
once, succeeds in tapping this fund of suppressed feeling, it
accordingly supplies a great need. It makes the dumb speak, and plucks
from the animal heart potentialities of expression which might render
it, perhaps, even more than human.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Music lends elementary feelings an intellectual communicable
form.</div>

<p>By its emotional range music is appropriate to all intense occasions: we
dance, pray, and mourn to music, and the more inadequate words or
external acts are to the situation, the more grateful music is. As the
only bond between music and life is emotion, music is out of place only
where emotion itself is absent. If it breaks in upon us in the midst of
study or business it becomes an interruption or alternative to our
activity, rather than an expression of it; we must either remain
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" />inattentive or pass altogether into the realm of sound (which may be
unemotional enough) and become musicians for the nonce. Music brings its
sympathetic ministry only to emotional moments; there it merges with
common existence, and is a welcome substitute for descriptive ideas,
since it co-operates with us and helps to deliver us from dumb
subjection to influences which we should not know how to meet otherwise.
There is often in what moves us a certain ruthless persistence, together
with a certain poverty of form; the power felt is out of proportion to
the interest awakened, and attention is kept, as in pain, at once
strained and idle. At such a moment music is a blessed resource. Without
attempting to remove a mood that is perhaps inevitable, it gives it a
congruous filling. Thus the mood is justified by an illustration or
expression which seems to offer some objective and ideal ground for its
existence; and the mood is at the same time relieved by absorption in
that impersonal object. So entertained, the feeling settles. The passion
to which at first we succumbed is now tamed and appropriated. We have
digested the foreign substance in giving it a rational form: its
energies are merged in that strength by which we freely operate.</p>

<p>In this way the most abstract of arts serves the dumbest emotions.
Matter which cannot enter the moulds of ordinary perception, capacities
which a ruling instinct usually keeps under, flow <a name="Page_59" id="Page_59" />suddenly into this
new channel. Music is like those branches which some trees put forth
close to the ground, far below the point where the other boughs
separate; almost a tree by itself, it has nothing but the root in common
with its parent. Somewhat in this fashion music diverts into an abstract
sphere a part of those forces which abound beneath the point at which
human understanding grows articulate. It nourishes on saps which other
branches of ideation are too narrow or rigid to take up. Those
elementary substances the musician can spiritualise by his special
methods, taking away their reproach and redeeming them from blind
intensity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All essences are in themselves good, even the passions.</div>

<p>There is consequently in music a sort of Christian piety, in that it
comes not to call the just but sinners to repentance, and understands
the spiritual possibilities in outcasts from the respectable world. If
we look at things absolutely enough, and from their own point of view,
there can be no doubt that each has its own ideal and does not question
its own justification. Lust and frenzy, revery or despair, fatal as they
may be to a creature that has general ulterior interests, are not
perverse in themselves: each searches for its own affinities, and has a
kind of inertia which tends to maintain it in being, and to attach or
draw in whatever is propitious to it. Feelings are as blameless as so
many forms of vegetation; they can be poisonous only to a different
life. They are all <a name="Page_60" id="Page_60" />primordial motions, eddies which the universal flux
makes for no reason, since its habit of falling into such attitudes is
the ground-work and exemplar for nature and logic alike. That such
strains should exist is an ultimate datum; justification cannot be
required of them, but must be offered to each of them in turn by all
that enters its particular orbit. There is no will but might find a
world to disport itself in and to call good, and thereupon boast to have
created that in which it found itself expressed. But such satisfaction
has been denied to the majority; the equilibrium of things has at least
postponed their day. Yet they are not altogether extinguished, since the
equilibrium of things is mechanical and results from no preconcerted
harmony such as would have abolished everything contrary to its own
perfection. Many ill-suppressed possibilities endure in matter, and peep
into being through the crevices, as it were, of the dominant world.
Weeds they are called by the tyrant, but in themselves they are aware of
being potential gods. Why should not every impulse expand in a congenial
paradise? Why should each, made evil now only by an adventitious
appellation or a contrary fate, not vindicate its own ideal? If there is
a piety towards things deformed, because it is not they that are
perverse, but the world that by its laws and arbitrary standards decides
to treat them as if they were, how much more should there be a piety
towards things altogether lovely, when it is only space and <a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" />matter that
are wanting for their perfect realisation?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Each impulse calls for a possible congenial world.</div>

<p>Philosophers talk of self-contradiction, but there is evidently no such
thing, if we take for the self what is really vital, each propulsive,
definite strain of being, each nucleus for estimation and for pleasure
and pain. Bach impulse may be contradicted, but not by itself; it may
find itself opposed, in a theatre which it has entered it knows not how,
by violent personages that it has never wished to encounter. The
environment it calls for is congenial with it: and by that environment
it could never be thwarted or condemned. The lumbering course of events
may indeed involve it in rum, and a mind with permanent interests to
defend may at once rule out everything inconsistent with possible
harmonies; but such rational judgments come from outside and represent a
compromise struck with material forces. Moral judgments and conflicts
are possible only in the mind that represents many interests
synthetically: in nature, where primary impulses collide, all conflict
is physical and all will innocent. Imagine some ingredient of humanity
loosed from its oppressive environment in human economy: it would at
once vegetate and flower into some ideal form, such as we see
exuberantly displayed in nature. If we can only suspend for a moment the
congested traffic in the brain, these initial movements will begin to
traverse it playfully and show their <a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" />paces, and we shall live in one of
those plausible worlds which the actual world has made impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Literature incapable of expressing pure feelings.</div>

<p>Man possesses, for example, a native capacity for joy. There are
moments, in friendship or in solitude, when joy is realised; but the
occasions are often trivial and could never justify in reflection the
feelings that then happen to bubble up. Nor can pure joy be long
sustained: cross-currents of lassitude or anxiety, distracting
incidents, irrelevant associations, trouble its course and make it
languish, turning it before long into dulness or melancholy. Language
cannot express a joy that shall be full and pure; for to keep the purity
nothing would have to be named which carried the least suggestion of
sadness with it, and, in the world that human language refers to, such a
condition would exclude every situation possible. &quot;O joy, O joy,&quot; would
be the whole ditty: hence some dialecticians, whose experience is
largely verbal, think whatever is pure necessarily thin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Music may do so.</div>

<p>That feeling should be so quickly polluted is, however, a superficial
and earthly accident. Spirit is clogged by what it flows through, but at
its springs it is both limpid and abundant. There is matter enough in
joy for many a universe, though the actual world has not a single form
quite fit to embody it, and its too rapid syllables are excluded from
the current hexameter. Music, on the contrary, has a more flexible
measure; its prosody ad<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63" />mits every word. Its rhythms can explicate every
emotion, through all degrees of complexity and volume, without once
disavowing it. Thus unused matter, which is not less fertile than that
which nature has absorbed, comes to fill out an infinity of ideal forms.
The joy condemned by practical exigencies to scintillate for a moment
uncommunicated, and then, as it were, to be buried alive, may now find
an abstract art to embody it and bring it before the public, formed into
a rich and constant object called a musical composition. So art succeeds
in vindicating the forgotten regions of spirit: a new spontaneous
creation shows how little authority or finality the given creation has.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Instability the soul of matter.</div>

<p>What is true of joy is no less true of sorrow, which, though it arises
from failure in some natural ideal, carries with it a sentimental ideal
of its own. Even confusion can find in music an expression and a
catharsis. That death or change should grieve does not follow from the
material nature of these phenomena. To change or to disappear might be
as normal a tendency as to move; and it actually happens, when nothing
ideal has been attained, that <i>not to be thus</i> is the whole law of
being. There is then a nameless satisfaction in passing on; which is the
virtual ideal of pain and mere willing. Death and change acquire a
tragic character when they invade a mind which is not ready for them in
all its parts, so that those elements in it which are <a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" />still vigorous,
and would maintain somewhat longer their ideal identity, suffer violence
at the hands of the others, already mastered by decay and willing to be
self-destructive. Thus a man whose physiological complexion involves
more poignant emotion than his ideas can absorb&mdash;one who is
sentimental&mdash;will yearn for new objects that may explain, embody, and
focus his dumb feelings; and these objects, if art can produce them,
will relieve and glorify those feelings in the act of expressing them.
Catharsis is nothing more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peace the triumph of spirit.</div>

<p>There would be no pleasure in expressing pain, if pain were not
dominated through its expression. To know how just a cause we have for
grieving is already a consolation, for it is already a shift from
feeling to understanding. By such consideration of a passion, the
intellectual powers turn it into subject-matter to operate upon. All
utterance is a feat, all apprehension a discovery; and this intellectual
victory, sounding in the midst of emotional struggles, hushes some part
of their brute importunity. It is at once sublime and beneficent, like a
god stilling a tempest. Melancholy can in this way be the food of art;
and it is no paradox that such a material may be beautiful when a fit
form is imposed upon it, since a fit form turns anything into an
agreeable object; its beauty runs as deep as its fitness, and stops
where its adaptation to human nature begins to fail. Whatever can
interest may prompt to expression, as it may have satisfied curiosity;
and the <a name="Page_65" id="Page_65" />mind celebrates a little triumph whenever it can formulate a
truth, however unwelcome to the flesh, or discover an actual force,
however unfavourable to given interests. As meditation on death and on
life make equally for wisdom, so the expression of sorrow and joy make
equally for beauty. Meditation and expression are themselves congenial
activities with an intrinsic value which is not lessened if what they
deal with could have been abolished to advantage. If once it exists, we
may understand and interpret it; and this reaction will serve a double
purpose. At first, in its very act, it will suffuse and mollify the
unwelcome experience by another, digesting it, which is welcome; and
later, by the broader adjustment which it will bring into the mind, it
will help us to elude or confront the evils thus laid clearly before us.</p>

<p>Catharsis has no such effect as a sophistical optimism wishes to
attribute to it; it does not show us that evil is good, or that calamity
and crime are things to be grateful for: so forced an apology for evil
has nothing to do with tragedy or wisdom; it belongs to apologetics and
an artificial theodicy. Catharsis is rather the consciousness of how
evil evils are, and how besetting; and how possible goods lie between
and involve serious renunciations. To understand, to accept, and to use
the situation in which a mortal may find himself is the function of art
and reason. Such mastery is desirable in itself and for its fruits; it
does not make itself responsible for the chaos of goods and <a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" />evils that
it supervenes upon. Whatever writhes in matter, art strives to give form
to; and however unfavourable the field may be for its activity, it does
what it can there, since no other field exists in which it may labour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Refinement is true strength.</div>

<p>Sad music pleases the melancholy because it is sad and other men because
it is music. When a composer attempts to reproduce complex conflicts in
his score he will please complex or disordered spirits for expressing
their troubles, but other men only for the order and harmony he may have
brought out of that chaos. The chaos in itself will offend, and it is no
part of rational art to produce it. As well might a physician poison in
order to give an antidote, or maim in order to amputate. The subject
matter of art is life, life as it actually is; but the function of art
is to make life better. The depth to which an artist may find current
experience to be sunk in discord and confusion is not his special
concern; his concern is, in some measure, to lift experience out. The
more barbarous his age, the more drastic and violent must be his
operation. He will have to shout in a storm. His strength must needs, in
such a case, be very largely physical and his methods sensational. In a
gentler age he may grow nobler, and blood and thunder will no longer
seem impressive. Only the weak are obliged to be violent; the strong,
having all means at command, need not resort to the worst. Refined art
is not wanting in power if the public is refined <a name="Page_67" id="Page_67" />also. And as
refinement comes only by experience, by comparison, by subordinating
means to ends and rejecting what hinders, it follows that a refined mind
will really possess the greater volume, as well as the subtler
discrimination. Its ecstasy without grimace, and its submission without
tears, will hold heaven and earth better together&mdash;and hold them better
apart&mdash;than could a mad imagination.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>SPEECH AND SIGNIFICATION</p>


<div class="sidenote">Sounds well fitted to be symbols.</div>

<p>Music rationalises sound, but a more momentous rationalising of sound is
seen in language. Language is one of the most useful of things, yet the
greater part of it still remains (what it must all have been in the
beginning) useless and without ulterior significance. The musical side
of language is its primary and elementary side. Man is endowed with
vocal organs so plastic as to emit a great variety of delicately varied
sounds; and by good fortune his ear has a parallel sensibility, so that
much vocal expression can be registered and confronted by auditory
feeling. It has been said that man's pre-eminence in nature is due to
his possessing hands; his modest participation in the ideal world may
similarly be due to his possessing tongue and ear. For when he finds
shouting and vague moaning after a while fatiguing, he can draw a new
pleasure from uttering all sorts of labial, dental, and gutteral sounds.
Their rhythms and oppositions can entertain him, and he can begin to use
his lingual gamut to designate the whole range of his perceptions and
passions.</p>

<p><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69" />Here we touch upon one of the great crises in creation. As nutrition at
first established itself in the face of waste, and reproduction in the
face of death, so representation was able, by help of vocal symbols, to
confront that dispersion inherent in experience, which is something in
itself ephemeral. Merely to associate one thing with another brings
little gain; and merely to have added a vocal designation to fleeting
things&mdash;a designation which of course would have been taken for a part
of their essence&mdash;would in itself have encumbered phenomena without
rendering them in any way more docile to the will. But the encumbrance
in this instance proved to be a wonderful preservative and means of
comparison. It actually gave each moving thing its niche and cenotaph in
the eternal. For the universe of vocal sounds was a field, like that of
colour or number, in which the elements showed relations and transitions
easy to dominate. It was a key-board over which attention could run back
and forth, eliciting many implicit harmonies. Henceforth when various
sounds had been idly associated with various things, and identified with
them, the things could, by virtue of their names, be carried over
mentally into the linguistic system; they could be manipulated there
ideally, and vicariously preserved in representation. Needless to say
that the things themselves remained unchanged all the while in their
efficacy and mechanical succession, just as they remain unchanged in
those respects when they pass for <a name="Page_70" id="Page_70" />the mathematical observer into their
measure or symbol; but as this reduction to mathematical form makes them
calculable, so their earlier reduction to words rendered them comparable
and memorable, first enabling them to figure in discourse at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Language has a structure independent of things.</div>

<p>Language had originally no obligation to subserve an end which we may
sometimes measure it by now, and depute to be its proper function,
namely, to stand for things and adapt itself perfectly to their
structure. In language as in every other existence idealism precedes
realism, since it must be a part of nature living its own life before it
can become a symbol for the rest and bend to external control. The vocal
and musical medium is, and must always remain, alien, to the spatial.
What makes terms correspond and refer to one another is a relation
eternally disparate from the relation of propinquity or derivation
between existences. Yet when sounds were attached to an event or
emotion, the sounds became symbols for that disparate fact. The net of
vocal relations caught that natural object as a cobweb might catch a
fly, without destroying or changing it. The object's quality passed to
the word at the same time that the word's relations enveloped the
object; and thus a new weight and significance was added to sound,
previously nothing but a dull music. A conflict at once established
itself between the drift proper to the verbal medium and that proper to
the des<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71" />ignated things; a conflict which the whole history of language
and thought has embodied and which continues to this day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Words remaining identical, serve to identify things that
change.</div>

<p>Suppose an animal going down to a frozen river which he had previously
visited in summer. Marks of all sorts would awaken in him an old train
of reactions; he would doubtless feel premonitions of satisfied thirst
and the splash of water. On finding, however, instead of the fancied
liquid, a mass of something like cold stone, he would be disconcerted.
His active attitude would be pulled up short and contradicted. In his
fairyland of faith and magic the old river would have been simply
annihilated, the dreamt-of water would have become a vanished ghost, and
this ice for the moment the hard reality. He would turn away and live
for a while on other illusions. When this shock was overgrown by time
and it was summer again, the original habit might, however, reassert
itself once more. If he revisited the stream, some god would seem to
bring back something from an old familiar world; and the chill of that
temporary estrangement, the cloud that for a while had made the good
invisible, would soon be gone and forgotten.</p>

<p>If we imagine, on the contrary, that this animal could speak and had
from the first called his haunt <i>the river</i>, he would have repeated its
name on seeing it even when it was frozen, for he had not failed to
recognise it in that guise. The varia<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72" />tion afterwards noticed, upon
finding it hard, would seem no total substitution, but a <i>change</i>; for
it would be the same river, once flowing, that was now congealed. An
identical word, covering all the identical qualities in the phenomena
and serving to abstract them, would force the inconsistent qualities in
those phenomena to pass for accidents; and the useful proposition could
at once be framed that the same river may be sometimes free and
sometimes frozen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Language the dialectical garment of facts.</div>

<p>This proposition is true, yet it contains much that is calculated to
offend a scrupulous dialectician. Its language and categories are not
purely logical, but largely physical and representative. The notion that
what changes nevertheless endures is a remarkable hybrid. It arises when
rigid ideal terms are imposed on evanescent existence. Feelings, taken
alone, would show no identities; they would be lost in changing, or be
woven into the infinite feeling of change. Notions, taken alone, would
allow no lapse, but would merely lead attention about from point to
point over an eternal system of relations. Power to understand the
world, logical or scientific mastery of existence, arises only by the
forced and conventional marriage of these two essences, when the actual
flux is ideally suspended and an ideal harness is loosely flung upon
things. For this purpose words are an admirable instrument. They have
dialectical relations based on an ideal import, or tendency to
definition, which makes <a name="Page_73" id="Page_73" />their essence their signification; yet they can
be freely bandied about and applied for a moment to the ambiguous things
that pass through existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Words are wise men's counters.</div>

<p>Had men been dumb, an exchange and circulation of images need not have
been wanting, and associations might have arisen between ideals in the
mind and corresponding reactive habits in the body. What words add is
not power of discernment or action, but a medium of intellectual
exchange. Language is like money, without which specific relative values
may well exist and be felt, but cannot be reduced to a common
denominator. And as money must have a certain intrinsic value of its own
in order that its relation to other values may be stable, so a word, by
which a thing is represented in discourse, must be a part of that
thing's context, an ingredient in the total apparition it is destined to
recall. Words, in their existence, are no more universal than gold by
nature is a worthless standard of value in other things. Words are a
material accompaniment of phenomena, at first an idle accompaniment, but
one which happens to subserve easily a universal function. Some other
element in objects might conceivably have served for a common
denominator between them; but words, just by virtue of their
adventitious, detachable status, and because they are so easily compared
and manipulated in the world of sound, were singularly well fitted for
this office. They are not vague, as any common quality abstracted from
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" />things would necessarily become; and though vagueness is a quality only
too compatible with perception, so that vague ideas can exist without
end, this vagueness is not what makes them universal in their functions.
It is one thing to perceive an ill-determined form and quite another to
attribute to it a precise general predicate. Words, distinct in their
own category and perfectly recognisable, can accordingly perform very
well the function of embodying a universal; for they can be identified
in turn with many particulars and yet remain throughout particular
themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nominalism right in psychology and realism in logic</div>

<p>The psychology of nominalism is undoubtedly right where it insists that
every image is particular and every term, in its existential aspect, a
<i>flatum vocis</i>; but nominalists should have recognised that images may
have any degree of vagueness and generality when measured by a
conceptual standard. A figure having obviously three sides and three
corners may very well be present to the mind when it is impossible to
say whether it is an equilateral or a rectangular triangle. Functional
or logical universality lies in another sphere altogether, being a
matter of intent and not of existence. When we say that &quot;universals
alone exist in the mind&quot; we mean by &quot;mind&quot; something unknown to
Berkeley; not a bundle of psychoses nor an angelic substance, but quick
intelligence, the faculty of discourse. Predication is an act,
understanding a spiritual and transitive operation: its existential
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" />basis may well be counted in psychologically and reduced to a stream of
immediate presences; but its meaning can be caught only by another
meaning, as life only can exemplify life. Vague or general images are as
little universal as sounds are; but a sound better than a flickering
abstraction can serve the intellect in its operation of comparison and
synthesis. Words are therefore the body of discourse, of which the soul
is understanding.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Literature moves between the extremes of music and
denotation.</div>

<p>The categories of discourse are in part merely representative, in part
merely grammatical, and in part attributable to both spheres. Euphony
and phonetic laws are principles governing language without any
reference to its meaning; here speech is still a sort of music. At the
other extreme lies that ultimate form of prose which we see in
mathematical reasoning or in a telegraphic style, where absolutely
nothing is rhetorical and speech is denuded of every feature not
indispensable to its symbolic r&ocirc;le. Between these two extremes lies the
broad field of poetry, or rather of imaginative or playful expression,
where the verbal medium is a medium indeed, having a certain
transparency, a certain reference to independent facts, but at the same
time elaborates the fact in expressing it, and endows it with affinities
alien to its proper nature. A pun is a grotesque example of such
diremption, where ambiguities belonging only to speech are used to
suggest impossible substitutions in ideas. Less frankly, language
habitu<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76" />ally wrests its subject-matter in some measure from its real
context and transfers it to a represented and secondary world, the world
of logic and reflection. Concretions in existence are subsumed, when
named, under concretions in discourse. Grammar lays violent hands upon
experience, and everything becomes a prey to wit and fancy, a material
for fiction and eloquence. Man's intellectual progress has a poetic
phase, in which he imagines the world; and then a scientific phase, in
which he sifts and tests what he has imagined.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sound and object, in their sensuous presence, may have
affinity.</div>

<p>In what measure do inflection and syntax represent anything in the
subject-matter of discourse? In what measure are they an independent
play of expression, a quasi-musical, quasi-mathematical veil interposed
between reflection and existence? One who knows only languages of a
single family can give but a biassed answer to this question. There are
doubtless many approaches to correct symbolism in language, which
grammar may have followed up at different times in strangely different
ways. That the medium in every art has a character of its own, a
character limiting its representative value, may perhaps be safely
asserted, and this intrinsic character in the medium antedates and
permeates all representation. Phonetic possibilities and phonetic habits
belong, in language, to this indispensable vehicle; what the throat and
lips can emit easily and distinguishably, and what sequences can appeal
to the ear and <a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" />be retained, depend alike on physiological conditions;
and no matter how convenient or inconvenient these conditions may be for
signification, they will always make themselves felt and may sometimes
remain predominant. In poetry they are still conspicuous. Euphony,
metre, and rhyme colour the images they transmit and add a charm wholly
extrinsic and imputed. In this immersion of the message in the medium
and in its intrinsic movement the magic of poetry lies; and the miracle
grows as there is more or less native analogy between the medium's
movement and that of the subject-matter.</p>

<p>Both language and ideas involve processes in the brain. The two
processes may be wholly disparate if we regard their objects only and
forget their seat, as Athena is in no way linked to an elephant's tusk;
yet in perception all processes are contiguous and exercise a single
organism, in which they may find themselves in sympathetic or
antipathetic vibration. On this circumstance hangs that subtle congruity
between subject and vehicle which is otherwise such a mystery in
expression. If to think of Athena and to look on ivory are congruous
physiological processes, if they sustain or heighten each other, then to
represent Athena in ivory will be a happy expedient, in which the very
nature of the medium will already be helping us forward. Scent and form
go better together, for instance, in the violet or the rose than in the
hyacinth or the poppy: and being better compacted <a name="Page_78" id="Page_78" />for human perception
they seem more expressive and can be linked more unequivocally with
other sources of feeling. So a given vocal sound may have more or less
analogy to the thing it is used to signify; this analogy may be obvious,
as in onomatopoeia, or subtle, as when short, sharp sounds go with
decision, or involved rhythms and vague reverberations with a floating
dream. What seems exquisite to one poet may accordingly seem vapid to
another, when the texture of experience in the two minds differs, so
that a given composition rustles through one man's fancy as a wind might
through a wood, but finds no sympathetic response in the other organism,
nerved as it may be, perhaps, to precision in thought and action.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Syntax positively representative.</div>

<p>The structure of language, when it passes beyond the phonetic level,
begins at once to lean upon existences and to imitate the structure of
things. We distinguish the parts of speech, for instance, in
subservience to distinctions which we make in ideas. The feeling or
quality represented by an adjective, the relation indicated by a verb,
the substance or concretion of qualities designated by a noun, are
diversities growing up in experience, by no means attributable to the
mere play of sound. The parts of speech are therefore representative.
Their inflection is representative too, since tenses mark important
practical differences in the distribution of the events described, and
cases express the respective r&ocirc;les played by objects in the operation.
&quot;I struck <a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" />him and he will strike me,&quot; renders in linguistic symbols a
marked change in the situation; the variation in phrase is not
rhetorical. Language here, though borrowed no doubt from ancestral
poetry, has left all revery far behind, and has been submerged in the
Life of Reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Yet it vitiates what it represents.</div>

<p>The medium, however, constantly reasserts itself. An example may be
found in gender, which, clearly representative in a measure, cuts loose
in language from all genuine representation and becomes a feature in
abstract linguistic design, a formal characteristic in expression.
Contrasted sentiments permeate an animal's dealings with his own sex and
with the other; nouns and adjectives represent this contrast by taking
on masculine and feminine forms. The distinction is indeed so important
that wholly different words&mdash;man and woman, bull and cow&mdash;stand for the
best-known animals of different sex; while adjectives, where declension
is extinct, as in English, often take on a connotation of gender and are
applied to one sex only&mdash;as we say a beautiful woman, but hardly a
beautiful man. But gender in language extends much farther than sex, and
even if by some subtle analogy all the masculine and feminine nouns in a
language could be attached to something suggesting sex in the objects
they designate, yet it can hardly be maintained that the elaborate
concordance incident upon that distinction is representative of any felt
quality in the things. So remote <a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" />an analogy to sex could not assert
itself pervasively. Thus Horace says:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quis <i>multa</i> gracilis te puer in <i>rosa</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">perfusis liquidis urget odoribus</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>grato</i>, Pyrrha, sub <i>antro</i>?</span><br />
</p>

<p>Here we may perceive why the rose was instinctively made feminine, and
we may grant that the bower, though the reason escape us, was somehow
properly masculine; but no one would urge that a <i>profusion</i> of roses
was also intrinsically feminine, or that the <i>pleasantness</i> of a bower
was ever specifically masculine to sense. The epithets <i>multa</i> and
<i>grato</i> take their gender from the nouns, even though the quality they
designate fails to do so. Their gender is therefore non-representative
and purely formal; it marks an intra-linguistic accommodation. The
medium has developed a syntactical structure apart from any intrinsic
significance thereby accruing to its elements. Artificial concordance in
gender does not express gender: it merely emphasises the grammatical
links in the phrases and makes greater variety possible in the
arrangement of words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty in subduing a living medium.</div>

<p>This example may prepare us to understand a general principle: that
language, while essentially significant viewed in its function, is
indefinitely wasteful, being mechanical and tentative in its origin. It
overloads itself, and being primarily music, and a labyrinth of sounds,
it develops an articula<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81" />tion and method of its own, which only in the
end, and with much inexactness, reverts to its function of expression.
How great the possibilities of effect are in developing a pure medium we
can best appreciate in music; but in language a similar development goes
on while it is being applied to representing things. The organ is
spontaneous, the function adventitious and superimposed. Rhetoric and
utility keep language going, as centrifugal and centripetal forces keep
a planet in its course. Euphony, verbal analogy, grammatical fancy,
poetic confusion, continually drive language afield, in its own
tangential direction; while the business of life, in which language is
employed, and the natural lapse of rhetorical fashions, as continually
draw it back towards convenience and exactitude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Language foreshortens experience.</div>

<p>Between music and bare symbolism language has its florid expansion.
Until music is subordinated, speech has little sense; it can hardly tell
a story or indicate an object unequivocally. Yet if music were left
behind altogether, language would pass into a sort of algebra or vocal
shorthand, without literary quality; it would become wholly indicative
and record facts without colouring them ideally. This medium and its
intrinsic development, though they make the bane of reproduction, make
the essence of art; they give representation a new and specific value
such as the object, before representation, could not have possessed.
Consciousness <a name="Page_82" id="Page_82" />itself is such a medium in respect to diffuse existence,
which it foreshortens and elevates into synthetic ideas. Reason, too, by
bringing the movement of events and inclinations to a head in single
acts of reflection, thus attaining to laws and purposes, introduces into
life the influence of a representative medium, without which life could
never pass from a process into an art. Language acquires scope in the
same way, by its kindly infidelities; its metaphors and syntax lend
experience perspective. Language vitiates the experience it expresses,
but thereby makes the burden of one moment relevant to that of another.
The two experiences, identified roughly with the same concretion in
discourse, are pronounced similar or comparable in character. Thus a
proverb, by its verbal pungency and rhythm, becomes more memorable than
the event it first described would ever have been if not translated into
an epigram and rendered, so to speak, applicable to new cases; for by
that translation the event has become an idea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is a perpetual mythology.</div>

<p>To turn events into ideas is the function of literature. Music, which in
a certain sense is a mass of pure forms, must leave its &quot;ideas&quot; imbedded
in their own medium&mdash;they are musical ideas&mdash;and cannot impose them on
any foreign material, such as human affairs. Science, on the contrary,
seeks to disclose the bleak anatomy of existence, stripping off as much
as possible the veil of prejudice and words. Literature takes a middle
course and <a name="Page_83" id="Page_83" />tries to subdue music, which for its purposes would be
futile and too abstract, into conformity with general experience, making
music thereby significant. Literary art in the end rejects all unmeaning
nourishes, all complications that have no counterpart in things or no
use in expressing their relations; at the same time it aspires to digest
that reality to which it confines itself, making it over into ideal
substance and material for the mind. It looks at things with an
incorrigibly dramatic eye, turning them into permanent unities (which
they never are) and almost into persons, grouping them by their
imaginative or moral affinities and retaining in them chiefly what is
incidental to their being, namely, the part they may chance to play in
man's adventures.</p>

<p>Such literary art demands a subject-matter other than the literary
impulse itself. The literary man is an interpreter and hardly succeeds,
as the musician may, without experience and mastery of human affairs.
His art is half genius and half fidelity. He needs inspiration; he must
wait for automatic musical tendencies to ferment in his mind, proving it
to be fertile in devices, comparisons, and bold assimilations. Yet
inspiration alone will lead him astray, for his art is relative to
something other than its own formal impulse; it comes to clarify the
real world, not to encumber it; and it needs to render its native
agility practical and to attach its volume of feeling to <a name="Page_84" id="Page_84" />what is
momentous in human life. Literature has its piety, its conscience; it
cannot long forget, without forfeiting all dignity, that it serves a
burdened and perplexed creature, a human animal struggling to persuade
the universal Sphinx to propose a more intelligible riddle.
Irresponsible and trivial in its abstract impulse, man's simian chatter
becomes noble as it becomes symbolic; its representative function lends
it a serious beauty, its utility endows it with moral worth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It may be apt or inapt, with equal richness.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Absolute language a possible but foolish art.</div>

<p>These relations, in determining the function of language, determine the
ideal which its structure should approach. Any sort of grammar and
rhetoric, the most absurd and inapplicable as well as the most
descriptive, can be spontaneous; fit organisms are not less natural than
those that are unfit. Felicitous genius is so called because it meets
experience half-way. A genius which flies in the opposite direction,
though not less fertile internally, is externally inept and is called
madness. Ineptitude is something which language needs to shake off.
Better surrender altogether some verbal categories and start again, in
that respect, with a clean slate, than persist in any line of
development that alienates thought from reality. The language of birds
is excellent in its way, and those ancient sages who are reported to
have understood it very likely had merely perceived that it was not
meant to be intelligible; for it is not to understand nature to reduce
her childishly to a human scale. Man, who <a name="Page_85" id="Page_85" />is merged in universal nature
at the roots of his being, is not without profound irrational intuitions
by which he can half divine her secret processes; and his heart, in its
own singing and fluttering, might not wholly misinterpret the birds. But
human discourse is not worth having if it is mere piping, and helps not
at all in mastering things; for man is intelligent, which is another way
of saying that he aspires to envisage in thought what he is dealing with
in action. Discourse that absolved itself from that observant duty would
not be cognitive; and in failing to be cognitive it would fail to redeem
the practical forces it ignored from their brute externality, and to
make them tributary to the Life of Reason. Thus its own dignity and
continued existence depend on its learning to express momentous facts,
facts important for action and happiness; and there is nothing which so
quickly discredits itself as empty rhetoric and dialectic, or poetry
that wanders in dim and private worlds. If pure music, even with its
immense sensuous appeal, is so easily tedious, what a universal yawn
must meet the verbiage which develops nothing but its own irridescence.
Absolute versification and absolute dialectic may have their place in
society; they give play to an organ that has its rights like any other,
and that, after serving for a while in the economy of life, may well
claim a holiday in which to disport itself irresponsibly among the fowls
of the air and the lilies of the field. <a name="Page_86" id="Page_86" />But the exercise is trivial;
and if its high priests go through their mummeries with a certain
unction, and pretend to be wafted by them into a higher world, the
phenomenon is neither new nor remarkable. Language is a wonderful and
pliant medium, and why should it not lend itself to imposture? A
systematic abuse of words, as of other things, is never without some
inner harmony or propriety that makes it prosper; only the man who looks
beyond and sees the practical results awakes to the villainy of it. In
the end, however, those who play with words lose their labour, and
pregnant as they feel themselves to be with new and wonderful universes,
they cannot humanise the one in which they live and rather banish
themselves from it by their persistent egotism and irrelevance.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>POETRY AND PROSE</p>


<div class="sidenote">Force of primary expressions.</div>

<p>There is both truth and illusion in the saying that primitive poets are
sublime. Genesis and the Iliad (works doubtless backed by a long
tradition) are indeed sublime. Primitive men, having perhaps developed
language before the other arts, used it with singular directness to
describe the chief episodes of life, which was all that life as yet
contained. They had frank passions and saw things from single points of
view. A breath from that early world seems to enlarge our natures, and
to restore to language, which we have sophisticated, all its
magnificence and truth. But there is more, for (as we have seen)
language is spontaneous; it constitutes an act before it registers an
observation. It gives vent to emotion before it is adjusted to things
external and reduced, as it were, to its own echo rebounding from a
refractory world. The lion's roar, the bellowing of bulls, even the
sea's cadence has a great sublimity. Though hardly in itself poetry, an
animal cry, when still audible in human language, renders it also the
unanswerable, the ultimate voice of nature. Nothing can so pierce the
soul as the <a name="Page_88" id="Page_88" />uttermost sigh of the body. There is no utterance so
thrilling as that of absolute impulse, if absolute impulse has learned
to speak at all. An intense, inhospitable mind, filled with a single
idea, in which all animal, social, and moral interests are fused
together, speaks a language of incomparable force. Thus the Hebrew
prophets, in their savage concentration, poured into one torrent all
that their souls possessed or could dream of. What other men are wont to
pursue in politics, business, religion, or art, they looked for from one
wave of national repentance and consecration. Their age, swept by this
ideal passion, possessed at the same time a fresh and homely vocabulary;
and the result was an eloquence so elemental and combative, so
imaginative and so bitterly practical, that the world has never heard
its like. Such single-mindedness, with such heroic simplicity in words
and images, is hardly possible in a late civilisation. Cultivated poets
are not unconsciously sublime.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its exclusiveness and narrowness.</div>

<p>The sublimity of early utterances should not be hailed, however, with
unmixed admiration. It is a sublimity born of defect or at least of
disproportion. The will asserts itself magnificently; images, like
thunder-clouds, seem to cover half the firmament at once. But such a
will is sadly inexperienced; it has hardly tasted or even conceived any
possible or high satisfactions. Its lurid firmament is poor in stars. To
throw the whole mind upon something is not <a name="Page_89" id="Page_89" />so great a feat when the
mind has nothing else to throw itself upon. Every animal when goaded
becomes intense; and it is perhaps merely the apathy in which mortals
are wont to live that keeps them from being habitually sublime in their
sentiments. The sympathy that makes a sheep hasten after its fellows, in
vague alarm or in vague affection; the fierce premonitions that drive a
bull to the heifer; the patience with which a hen sits on her eggs; the
loyalty which a dog shows to his master&mdash;what thoughts may not all these
instincts involve, which it needs only a medium of communication to
translate into poetry?</p>

<p>Man, though with less wholeness of soul, enacts the same dramas. He
hears voices on all occasions; he incorporates what little he observes
of nature into his verbal dreams; and as each new impulse bubbles to the
surface he feels himself on the verge of some inexpressible heaven or
hell. He needs but to abandon himself to that seething chaos which
perpetually underlies conventional sanity&mdash;a chaos in which memory and
prophecy, vision and impersonation, sound and sense, are inextricably
jumbled together&mdash;to find himself at once in a magic world,
irrecoverable, largely unmeaning, terribly intricate, but, as he will
conceive, deep, inward, and absolutely real. He will have reverted, in
other words, to crude experience, to primordial illusion. The movement
of his animal or vegetative mind will be far from delightful; it will be
unintelligent and unintelligible; nothing <a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" />in particular will be
represented therein; but it will be a movement in the soul and for the
soul, as exciting and compulsive as the soul's volume can make it. In
this muddy torrent words also may be carried down; and if these words
are by chance strung together into a cadence, and are afterwards written
down, they may remain for a memento of that turbid moment. Such words we
may at first hesitate to call poetry, since very likely they are
nonsense; but this nonsense will have some quality&mdash;some rhyme or
rhythm&mdash;that makes it memorable (else it would not have survived); and
moreover the words will probably show, in their connotation and order,
some sympathy with the dream that cast them up. For the man himself, in
whom such a dream may be partly recurrent, they may consequently have a
considerable power of suggestion, and they may even have it for others,
whenever the rhythm and incantation avail to plunge them also into a
similar trance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rudimentary poetry an incantation or charm.</div>

<p>Memorable nonsense, or sound with a certain hypnotic power, is the
really primitive and radical form of poetry. Nor is such poetry yet
extinct: children still love and compose it and every genuine poet, on
one side of his genius, reverts to it from explicit speech. As all
language has acquired its meaning, and did not have it in the beginning,
so the man who launches a new locution, the poet who creates a symbol,
must do so without knowing <a name="Page_91" id="Page_91" />what significance it may eventually acquire,
and conscious at best only of the emotional background from which it
emerged. Pure poetry is pure experiment; and it is not strange that
nine-tenths of it should be pure failure. For it matters little what
unutterable things may have originally gone together with a phrase in
the dreamer's mind; if they were not uttered and the phrase cannot call
them back, this verbal relic is none the richer for the high company it
may once have kept. Expressiveness is a most accidental matter. What a
line suggests at one reading, it may never suggest again even to the
same person. For this reason, among others, poets are partial to their
own compositions; they truly discover there depths of meaning which
exist for nobody else. Those readers who appropriate a poet and make him
their own fall into a similar illusion; they attribute to him what they
themselves supply, and whatever he reels out, lost in his own personal
revery, seems to them, like <i>sortes biblicoe,</i> written to fit their own
case.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inspiration irresponsible.</div>

<p>Justice has never been done to Plato's remarkable consistency and
boldness in declaring that poets are inspired by a divine madness and
yet, when they transgress rational bounds, are to be banished from an
ideal republic, though not without some marks of Platonic regard.
Instead of fillets, a modern age might assign them a coterie of
flattering dames, and instead of banishment, starvation; but the result
would be <a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" />the same in the end. A poet is inspired because what occurs in
his brain is a true experiment in creation. His apprehension plays with
words and their meanings as nature, in any spontaneous variation, plays
with her own structure. A mechanical force shifts the kaleidoscope; a
new direction is given to growth or a new gist to signification. This
inspiration, moreover, is mad, being wholly ignorant of its own issue;
and though it has a confused fund of experience and verbal habit on
which to draw, it draws on this fund blindly and quite at random,
consciously possessed by nothing but a certain stress and pregnancy and
the pains, as it were, of parturition. Finally the new birth has to be
inspected critically by the public censor before it is allowed to live;
most probably it is too feeble and defective to prosper in the common
air, or is a monster that violates some primary rule of civic existence,
tormenting itself to disturb others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plato's discriminating view.</div>

<p>Plato seems to have exaggerated the havoc which these poetic dragons can
work in the world. They are in fact more often absurd than venomous, and
no special legislation is needed to abolish them. They soon die quietly
of universal neglect. The poetry that ordinarily circulates among a
people is poetry of a secondary and conventional sort that propagates
established ideas in trite metaphors. Popular poets are the parish
priests of the Muse, retailing her ancient divinations to a long since
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93" />converted public. Plato's quarrel was not so much with poetic art as
with ancient myth and emotional laxity: he was preaching a crusade
against the established church. For naturalistic deities he wished to
substitute moral symbols; for the joys of sense, austerity and
abstraction. To proscribe Homer was a marked way of protesting against
the frivolous reigning ideals. The case is much as if we should now
proscribe the book of Genesis, on account of its mythical cosmogony, or
in order to proclaim the philosophic truth that the good, being an
adequate expression to be attained by creation, could not possibly have
preceded it or been its source. We might admit at the same time that
Genesis contains excellent images and that its poetic force is
remarkable; so that if serious misunderstanding could be avoided the
censor might be glad to leave it in everybody's hands. Plato in some
such way recognised that Homer was poetical and referred his works,
mischievous as they might prove incidentally, to divine inspiration.
Poetic madness, like madness in prophecy or love, bursts the body of
things to escape from it into some ideal; and even the Homeric world,
though no model for a rational state, was a cheerful heroic vision,
congenial to many early impulses and dreams of the mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Explosive and pregnant expression.</div>

<p>Homer, indeed, was no primitive poet; he was a consummate master, the
heir to generations of discipline in both life and art. This appears in
his perfect prosody, in his limpid style, in his sense <a name="Page_94" id="Page_94" />for proportion,
his abstentions, and the frank pathos of his portraits and principles,
in which there is nothing gross, subjective, or arbitrary. The
inspirations that came to him never carried him into crudeness or
absurdity. Every modern poet, though the world he describes may be more
refined in spots and more elaborate, is less advanced in his art; for
art is made rudimentary not by its date but by its irrationality. Yet
even if Homer had been primitive he might well have been inspired, in
the same way as a Bacchic frenzy or a mystic trance; the most blundering
explosions may be justified antecedently by the plastic force that is
vented in them. They may be expressive, in the physical sense of this
ambiguous word; for, far as they may be from conveying an idea, they may
betray a tendency and prove that something is stirring in the soul.
Expressiveness is often sterile; but it is sometimes fertile and capable
of reproducing in representation the experience from which it sprang. As
a tree in the autumn sheds leaves and seeds together, so a ripening
experience comes indifferently to various manifestations, some barren
and without further function, others fit to carry the parent experience
over into another mind, and give it a new embodiment there.
Expressiveness in the former case is dead, like that of a fossil; in the
latter it is living and efficacious, recreating its original. The first
is idle self-manifestation, the second rational art.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95" />Natural history of inspiration.</div>

<p>Self-manifestation, so soon as it is noted and accepted as such, seems
to present the same marvel as any ideal success. Such self-manifestation
is incessant, many-sided, unavoidable; yet it seems a miracle when its
conditions are looked back upon from the vantage ground of their result.
By reading spirit out of a work we turn it into a feat of inspiration.
Thus even the crudest and least coherent utterances, when we suspect
some soul to be groping in them, and striving to address us, become
oracular; a divine afflatus breathes behind their gibberish and they
seem to manifest some deep intent. The miracle of creation or
inspiration consists in nothing but this, that an external effect should
embody an inner intention. The miracle, of course, is apparent only, and
due to an inverted and captious point of view. In truth the tendency
that executed the work was what first made its conception possible; but
this conception, finding the work responsive in some measure to its
inner demand, attributes that response to its own magic prerogative.
Hence the least stir and rumble of formative processes, when it
generates a soul, makes itself somehow that soul's interpreter; and dim
as the spirit and its expression may both remain, they are none the less
in profound concord, a concord which wears a miraculous providential
character when it is appreciated without being understood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expressions to be understood must be recreated, and so
changed.</div>

<p>Primitive poetry is the basis of all discourse. <a name="Page_96" id="Page_96" />If we open any ancient
book we come at once upon an elaborate language, and on divers
conventional concepts, of whose origin and history we hear nothing. We
must read on, until by dint of guessing and by confronting instances we
grow to understand those symbols. The writer was himself heir to a
linguistic tradition which he made his own by the same process of
adoption and tentative use by which we, in turn, interpret his phrases:
he understood what he heard in terms of his own experience, and
attributed to his predecessors (no matter what their incommunicable
feelings may have been) such ideas as their words generated in his own
thinking. In this way expressions continually change their sense; they
can communicate a thought only by diffusing a stimulus, and in passing
from mouth to mouth they will wholly reverse their connotation, unless
some external object or some recurring human situation gives them a
constant standard, by which private aberrations may be checked. Thus in
the first phrase of Genesis, &quot;In the beginning God created the heavens
and the earth,&quot; the words have a stable meaning only in so far as they
are indicative and bring us back to a stable object. What &quot;heavens&quot; and
&quot;earth&quot; stand for can be conveyed by gestures, by merely pointing up and
down; but beyond that sensuous connotation their meaning has entirely
changed since they were here written; and no two minds, even to-day,
will respond to these <a name="Page_97" id="Page_97" />familiar words with exactly the same images.
&quot;Beginning&quot; and &quot;created&quot; have a superficial clearness, though their
implications cannot be defined without precipitating the most intricate
metaphysics, which would end in nothing but a proof that both terms were
ambiguous and unthinkable. As to the word &quot;God,&quot; all mutual
understanding is impossible. It is a floating literary symbol, with a
value which, if we define it scientifically, becomes quite algebraic. As
no experienced object corresponds to it, it is without fixed indicative
force, and admits any sense which its context in any mind may happen to
give it. In the first sentence of Genesis its meaning, we may safely
say, is &quot;a masculine being by whom heaven and earth were created.&quot; To
fill out this implication other instances of the word would have to be
gathered, in each of which, of course, the word would appear with a new
and perhaps incompatible meaning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expressions may be recast perversely, humorously, or
sublimely.</div>

<p>Whenever a word appears in a radically new context it has a radically
new sense: the expression in which it so figures is a poetic figment, a
fresh literary creation. Such invention is sometimes perverse, sometimes
humorous, sometimes sublime; that is, it may either buffet old
associations without enlarging them, or give them a plausible but
impossible twist, or enlarge them to cover, with unexpected propriety, a
much wider or more momentous experience. The force of experience in <a name="Page_98" id="Page_98" />any
moment&mdash;if we abstract from represented values&mdash;is emotional; so that
for sublime poetry what is required is to tap some reservoir of feeling.
If a phrase opens the flood-gates of emotion, it has made itself most
deeply significant. Its discursive range and clearness may not be
remarkable; its emotional power will quite suffice. For this reason
again primitive poetry may be sublime: in its inchoate phrases there is
affinity to raw passion and their very blindness may serve to bring that
passion back. Poetry has body; it represents the volume of experience as
well as its form, and to express volume a primitive poet will rely
rather on rhythm, sound, and condensed suggestion than on discursive
fulness or scope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nature of prose.</div>

<p>The descent from poetry to prose is in one sense a progress. When use
has worn down a poetic phrase to its external import, and rendered it an
indifferent symbol for a particular thing, that phrase has become
prosaic; it has also become, by the same process, transparent and purely
instrumental. In poetry feeling is transferred by contagion; in prose it
is communicated by bending the attention upon determinate objects; the
one stimulates and the other informs. Under the influence of poetry
various minds radiate from a somewhat similar core of sensation, from
the same vital mood, into the most diverse and incommunicable images.
Interlocutors speaking prose, on the contrary, pelt and besiege one
another with a peripheral attack; they come into <a name="Page_99" id="Page_99" />contact at sundry
superficial points and thence push their agreement inwards, until
perhaps a practical coincidence is arrived at in their thought.
Agreement is produced by controlling each mind externally, through a
series of checks and little appeals to possible sensation; whereas in
poetry the agreement, where it exists, is vague and massive; there is an
initial fusion of minds under hypnotic musical influences, from which
each listener, as he awakes, passes into his own thoughts and
interpretations. In prose the vehicle for communication is a
conventional sign, standing in the last analysis for some demonstrable
object or controllable feeling. By marshalling specific details a
certain indirect suasion is exercised on the mind, as nature herself, by
continual checks and denials, gradually tames the human will. The
elements of prose are always practical, if we run back and reconstruct
their primitive essence, for at bottom every experience is an original
and not a copy, a nucleus for ideation rather than an object to which
ideas may refer. It is when these stimulations are shaken together and
become a system of mutual checks that they begin to take on ideally a
rhythm borrowed from the order in which they actually recurred. Then a
prophetic or representative movement arises in thought. Before this
comes about, experience remains a constantly renovated dream, as poetry
to the end conspires to keep it. For poetry, while truly poetical, never
loses sight of initial feelings and underlying appeals; it <a name="Page_100" id="Page_100" />is
incorrigibly transcendental, and takes every present passion and every
private dream in turn for the core of the universe. By creating new
signs, or by recasting and crossing those which have become
conventional, it keeps communication massive and instinctive, immersed
in music, and inexhaustible by clear thought.</p>


<div class="sidenote">It is more advanced and responsible than poetry.</div>

<p>Lying is a privilege of poets because they have not yet reached the
level on which truth and error are discernible. Veracity and
significance are not ideals for a primitive mind; we learn to value them
as we learn to live, when we discover that the spirit cannot be wholly
free and solipsistic. To have to distinguish fact from fancy is so great
a violence to the inner man that not only poets, but theologians and
philosophers, still protest against such a distinction. They urge (what
is perfectly true for a rudimentary creature) that facts are mere
conceptions and conceptions full-fledged facts; but this interesting
embryonic lore they apply, in their intellectual weakness, to retracting
or undermining those human categories which, though alone fruitful or
applicable in life, are not congenial to their half-formed imagination.
Retreating deeper into the inner chaos, they bring to bear the whole
momentum of an irresponsible dialectic to frustrate the growth of
representative ideas: In this they are genuine, if somewhat belated,
poets, experimenting anew with solved problems, and fancying how
creation might have <a name="Page_101" id="Page_101" />moved upon other lines. The great merit that prose
shares with science is that it is responsible. Its conscience is a new
and wiser imagination, by which creative thought is rendered cumulative
and progressive; for a man does not build less boldly or solidly if he
takes the precaution of building in baked brick. Prose is in itself
meagre and bodiless, merely indicating the riches of the world. Its
transparency helps us to look through it to the issue, and the signals
it gives fill the mind with an honest assurance and a prophetic art far
nobler than any ecstasy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Maturity brings love of practical truth.</div>

<p>As men of action have a better intelligence than poets, if only their
action is on a broad enough stage, so the prosaic rendering of
experience has the greater value, if only the experience rendered covers
enough human interests. Youth and aspiration indulge in poetry; a mature
and masterful mind will often despise it, and prefer to express itself
laconically in prose. It is clearly proper that prosaic habits should
supervene in this way on the poetical; for youth, being as yet little
fed by experience, can find volume and depth only in the soul; the
half-seen, the supra-mundane, the inexpressible, seem to it alone
beautiful and worthy of homage. Time modifies this sentiment in two
directions. It breeds lassitude and indifference towards impracticable
ideals, originally no less worthy than the practicable. Ideals which
cannot be realised, and are not fed at least by partial real<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102" />isations,
soon grow dormant. Life-blood passes to other veins; the urgent and
palpitating interests of life appear in other quarters. While things
impossible thus lose their serious charm, things actual reveal their
natural order and variety; these not only can entertain the mind
abstractly, but they can offer a thousand material rewards in
observation and action. In their presence, a private dream begins to
look rather cheap and hysterical. Not that existence has any dignity or
prerogative in the presence of will, but that will itself, being
elastic, grows definite and firm when it is fed by success; and its
formed and expressible ideals then put to shame the others, which have
remained vague for want of practical expression. Mature interests centre
on soluble problems and tasks capable of execution; it is at such points
that the ideal can be really served. The individual's dream straightens
and reassures itself by merging with the dream of humanity. To dwell, as
irrational poets do, on some private experience, on some emotion without
representative or ulterior value, then seems a waste of time. Fiction
becomes less interesting than affairs, and poetry turns into a sort of
incompetent whimper, a childish fore-shortening of the outspread world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pure prose would tend to efface itself.</div>

<p>On the other hand, prose has a great defect, which is abstractness. It
drops the volume of experience in finding bodiless algebraic symbols by
which to express it. The verbal form, instead of transmitting an image,
seems to constitute it, in <a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" />so far as there is an image suggested at
all; and the ulterior situation is described only in the sense that a
change is induced in the hearer which prepares him to meet that
situation. Prose seems to be a use of language in the service of
material life. It would tend, in that case, to undermine its own basis;
for in proportion as signals for action are quick and efficacious they
diminish their sensuous stimulus and fade from consciousness. Were
language such a set of signals it would be something merely
instrumental, which if made perfect ought to be automatic and
unconscious. It would be a buzzing in the ears, not a music native to
the mind. Such a theory of language would treat it as a necessary evil
and would look forward hopefully to the extinction of literature, in
which it would recognise nothing ideal. There is of course no reason to
deprecate the use of vocables, or of any other material agency, to
expedite affairs; but an art of speech, if it is to add any ultimate
charm to life, has to supervene upon a mere code of signals. Prose,
could it be purely representative, would be ideally superfluous. A
literary prose accordingly owns a double allegiance, and its life is
amphibious. It must convey intelligence, but intelligence clothed in a
language that lends the message an intrinsic value, and makes it
delightful to apprehend apart from its importance in ultimate theory or
practice. Prose is in that measure a fine art. It might be called poetry
that had become per<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" />vasively representative, and was altogether faithful
to its rational function.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Form alone, or substance alone, may be poetical.</div>

<p>We may therefore with good reason distinguish prosaic form from prosaic
substance. A novel, a satire, a book of speculative philosophy, may have
a most prosaic exterior; every phrase may convey its idea economically;
but the substance may nevertheless be poetical, since these ideas may be
irrelevant to all ulterior events, and may express nothing but the
imaginative energy that called them forth. On the other hand, a poetic
vehicle in which there is much ornamental play of language and rhythm
may clothe a dry ideal skeleton. So those tremendous positivists, the
Hebrew prophets, had the most prosaic notions about the goods and evils
of life. So Lucretius praised, I will not say the atoms merely, but even
fecundity and wisdom. The motives, to take another example, which Racine
attributed to his personages, were prosaically conceived; a physiologist
could not be more exact in his calculations, for even love may be made
the mainspring in a clock-work of emotions. Yet that Racine was a born
poet appears in the music, nobility, and tenderness of his medium; he
clothed his intelligible characters in magical and tragic robes; the
aroma of sentiment rises like a sort of pungent incense between them and
us, and no dramatist has ever had so sure a mastery over transports and
tears.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poetry has its place in the medium.</div>

<p>In the medium a poet is at home; in the world <a name="Page_105" id="Page_105" />he tries to render, he is
a child and a stranger. Poetic notions are false notions; in so far as
their function is representative they are vitiated by containing
elements not present in things. Truth is a jewel which should not be
painted over; but it may be set to advantage and shown in a good light.
The poetic way of idealising reality is dull, bungling, and impure; a
better acquaintance with things renders such flatteries ridiculous. That
very effort of thought by which opaque masses of experience were first
detached from the flux and given a certain individuality, seeks to
continue to clarify them until they become as transparent as possible.
To resist this clarification, to love the chance incrustations that
encumber human ideas, is a piece of timid folly, and poetry in this
respect is nothing but childish confusion. Poetic apprehension is a
makeshift, in so far as its cognitive worth is concerned; it is exactly,
in this respect, what myth is to science. Approaching its subject-matter
from a distance, with incongruous categories, it translates it into some
vague and misleading symbol rich in emotions which the object as it is
could never arouse and is sure presently to contradict. What lends these
hybrid ideas their temporary eloquence and charm is their congruity with
the mind that breeds them and with its early habits. Falsification, or
rather clouded vision, gives to poetry a more human accent and a readier
welcome than to truth. In other words, it is the <a name="Page_106" id="Page_106" />medium that asserts
itself; the apperceptive powers indulge their private humours, and
neglect the office to which they were assigned once for all by their
cognitive essence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is the best medium possible.</div>

<p>That the medium should so assert itself, however, is no anomaly, the
cognitive function being an ulterior one to which ideas are by no means
obliged to conform. Apperception is itself an activity or art, and like
all others terminates in a product which is a good in itself, apart from
its utilities. If we abstract, then, from the representative function
which may perhaps accrue to speech, and regard it merely as an operation
absorbing energy and occasioning delight, we see that poetic language is
language at its best. Its essential success consists in fusing ideas in
charming sounds or in metaphors that shine by their own brilliance.
Poetry is an eloquence justified by its spontaneity, as eloquence is a
poetry justified by its application. The first draws the whole soul into
the situation, and the second puts the whole situation before the soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Might it not convey what it is best to know?</div>

<p>Is there not, we may ask, some ideal form of discourse in which
apperceptive life could be engaged with all its volume and transmuting
power, and in which at the same time no misrepresentation should be
involved? Transmutation is not erroneous when it is intentional;
misrepresentation does not please for being false, but only because
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107" />truth would be more congenial if it resembled such a fiction. Why
should not discourse, then, have nothing but truth in its import and
nothing but beauty in its form? With regard to euphony and grammatical
structure there is evidently nothing impossible in such an ideal; for
these radical beauties of language are independent of the
subject-matter. They form the body of poetry; but the ideal and
emotional atmosphere which is its soul depends on things external to
language, which no perfection in the medium could modify. It might seem
as if the brilliant substitutions, the magic suggestions essential to
poetry, would necessarily vanish in the full light of day. The light of
day is itself beautiful; but would not the loss be terrible if no other
light were ever suffered to shine?</p>

<div class="sidenote">A rational poetry would exclude much now thought poetical.</div>

<p>The Life of Reason involves sacrifice. What forces yearn for the ideal,
being many and incompatible, have to yield and partly deny themselves in
order to attain any ideal at all. There is something sad in all possible
attainment so long as the rational virtue (which wills such attainment)
is not pervasive; and even then there is limitation to put up with, and
the memory of many a defeat. Rational poetry is possible and would be
infinitely more beautiful than the other; but the charm of unreason, if
unreason seem charming, it certainly could not preserve. In what human
fancy demands, as at present constituted, there are irra<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108" />tional
elements. The given world seems insufficient; impossible things have to
be imagined, both to extend its limits and to fill in and vivify its
texture. Homer has a mythology without which experience would have
seemed to him undecipherable; Dante has his allegories and his mock
science; Shakespeare has his romanticism; Goethe his symbolic characters
and artificial machinery. All this lumber seems to have been somehow
necessary to their genius; they could not reach expression in more
honest terms. If such indirect expression could be discarded, it would
not be missed; but while the mind, for want of a better vocabulary, is
reduced to using these symbols, it pours into them a part of its own
life and makes them beautiful. Their loss is a real blow, while the
incapacity that called for them endures; and the soul seems to be
crippled by losing its crutches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All apperception modifies its object.</div>

<p>There are certain adaptations and abbreviations of reality which thought
can never outgrow. Thought is representative; it enriches each soul and
each moment with premonitions of surrounding existences. If discourse is
to be significant it must transfer to its territory and reduce to its
scale whatever objects it deals with: in other words, thought has a
point of view and cannot see the world except in perspective. This point
of view is not, for reason, locally or naturally determined; sense alone
is limited in that material fashion, being seated in the body and
looking thence centrifugally upon things <a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" />in so far as they come into
dynamic relations with that body. Intelligence, on the contrary, sallies
from that physical stronghold and consists precisely in shifting and
universalising the point of view, neutralising all local, temporal, or
personal conditions. Yet intelligence, notwithstanding, has its own
centre and point of origin, not explicitly in space or in a natural
body, but in some specific interest or moral aim. It translates animal
life into moral endeavour, and what figured in the first as a local
existence figures in the second as a specific good. Reason accordingly
has its essential bias, and looks at things as they affect the
particular form of life which reason expresses; and though all reality
should be ultimately swept by the eye of reason, the whole would still
be surveyed by a particular method, from a particular starting-point,
for a particular end; nor would it take much shrewdness to perceive that
this nucleus for discourse and estimation, this ideal life, corresponds
in the moral world to that animal body which gave sensuous experience
its seat and centre; so that rationality is nothing but the ideal
function or aspect of natural life. Reason is universal in its outlook
and in its sympathies: it is the faculty of changing places ideally and
representing alien points of view; but this very self-transcendence
manifests a certain special method in life, an equilibrium which a
far-sighted being is able to establish between itself and its
comprehended conditions. Reason remains to the end essentially <a name="Page_110" id="Page_110" />human
and, in its momentary actuality, necessarily personal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reason has its own bias and method.</div>

<p>We have here an essential condition of discourse which renders it at
bottom poetical. Selection and applicability govern all thinking, and
govern it in the interests of the soul. Reason is itself a specific
medium; so that prose can never attain that perfect transparency and
mere utility which we were attributing to it. We should not wish to know
&quot;things in themselves,&quot; even if we were able. What it concerns us to
know about them is merely the service or injury they are able to do us,
and in what fashion they can affect our lives. To know this would be, in
so far, truly to know them; but it would be to know them through our own
faculties and through their supposed effects; it would be to know them
by their appearance. A singular proof of the frivolous way in which
philosophers often proceed, when they think they are particularly
profound, is seen in this puzzle, on which they solemnly ask us to fix
our thoughts: How is it possible to know reality, if all we can attain
in experience is but appearance? The meaning of knowledge, which is an
intellectual and living thing, is here forgotten, and the notion of
sensation, or bodily possession, is substituted for it; so what we are
really asked to consider is how, had we no understanding, we should be
able to understand what we endure. It is by conceiving what we endure to
be the appearance of something beyond us, that we reach knowl<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111" />edge that
something exists beyond us, and that it plays in respect to us a
determinate r&ocirc;le. There could be no knowledge of reality if what
conveyed that knowledge were not felt to be appearance; nor can a medium
of knowledge better than appearance be by any possibility conceived. To
have such appearances is what makes realities knowable. Knowledge
transcends sensation by relating it to other sensation, and thereby
rising to a supersensuous plane, the plane of principles and causes by
which sensibles are identified in character and distributed in
existence. These principles and causes are what we call the intelligible
or the real world; and the sensations, when they have been so
interpreted and underpinned, are what we call experience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rational poetry would envelop exact knowledge in ultimate
emotions.</div>

<p>If a poet could clarify the myths he begins with, so as to reach
ultimate scientific notions of nature and life, he would still be
dealing with vivid feeling and with its imaginative expression. The
prosaic landscape before him would still be a work of art, painted on
the human brain by human reason. If he found that landscape
uninteresting, it would be because he was not really interested in life;
if he found it dull and unpoetical, he would be manifesting his small
capacity and childish whims. Tragic, fatal, intractable, he might well
feel that the truth was; but these qualities have never been absent from
that half-mythical world through which poets, for want of a rational
edu<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" />cation, have hitherto wandered. A rational poet's vision would have
the same moral functions which myth was asked to fulfil, and fulfilled
so treacherously; it would employ the same ideal faculties which myth
expressed in a confused and hasty fashion. More detail would have been
added, and more variety in interpretation. To deal with so great an
object, and retain his mastery over it, a poet would doubtless need a
robust genius. If he possessed it, and in transmuting all existence
falsified nothing, giving that picture of everything which human
experience in the end would have drawn, he would achieve an ideal
result. In prompting mankind to imagine, he would be helping them to
live. His poetry, without ceasing to be a fiction in its method and
ideality, would be an ultimate truth in its practical scope. It would
present in graphic images the total efficacy of real things. Such a
poetry would be more deeply rooted in human experience than is any
casual fancy, and therefore more appealing to the heart. Such a poetry
would represent more thoroughly than any formula the concrete burden of
experience; it would become the most trustworthy of companions. The
images it had worked out would confront human passion more intelligibly
than does the world as at present conceived, with its mechanism half
ignored and its ideality half invented; they would represent vividly the
uses of nature, and thereby make all natural situations seem so many
incentives to art.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113" />An illustration.</div>

<p>Rational poetry is not wholly unknown. When Homer mentions an object,
how does he render it poetical? First, doubtless, by the euphony of its
name or the sensuous glow of some epithet coupled with it. Sometimes,
however, even this ornamental epithet is not merely sensuous; it is very
likely a patronymic, the name of some region or some mythical ancestor.
In other words, it is a signal for widening our view and for conceiving
the object, not only vividly and with pause, but in an adequate historic
setting. Macbeth tells us that his dagger was &quot;unmannerly breeched in
gore.&quot; Achilles would not have amused himself with such a metaphor, even
if breeches had existed in his day, but would rather have told us whose
blood, on other occasions, had stained the same blade, and perhaps what
father or mother had grieved for the slaughtered hero, or what brave
children remained to continue his race. Shakespeare's phrase is
ingenious and fanciful; it dazzles for a moment, but in the end it seems
violent and crude. What Homer would have said, on the contrary, being
simple and true, might have grown, as we dwelt upon it, always more
noble, pathetic, and poetical. Shakespeare, too, beneath his occasional
absurdities of plot and diction, ennobles his stage with actual history,
with life painted to the quick, with genuine human characters, politics,
and wisdom; and surely these are not the elements that do least credit
to his genius. In every poet, in<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114" />deed, there is some fidelity to nature,
mixed with that irrelevant false fancy with which poetry is sometimes
identified; and the degree in which a poet's imagination dominates
reality is, in the end, the exact measure of his importance and dignity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Volume can be found in scope better than in suggestion.</div>

<p>Before prosaic objects are descried, the volume and richness needful for
poetry lie in a blurred and undigested chaos; but after the common world
has emerged and has called on prose to describe it, the same volume and
richness may be recovered; and a new and clarified poetry may arise
through synthesis. Scope is a better thing than suggestion, and more
truly poetical. It has expressed what suggestion pointed to and felt in
the bulk: it possesses what was yearned for. A real thing, when all its
pertinent natural associates are discerned, touches wonder, pathos, and
beauty on every side; the rational poet is one who, without feigning
anything unreal, perceives these momentous ties, and presents his
subject loaded with its whole fate, missing no source of worth which is
in it, no ideal influence which it may have. Homer remains, perhaps, the
greatest master in this art. The world he glorified by showing in how
many ways it could serve reason and beauty was but a simple world, and
an equal genius in these days might be distracted by the Babel about
him, and be driven, as poets now are, into incidental dreams. Yet the
ideal of mastery and idealisation remains <a name="Page_115" id="Page_115" />the same, if any one could
only attain it: mastery, to see things as they are and dare to describe
them ingenuously; idealisation, to select from this reality what is
pertinent to ultimate interests and can speak eloquently to the soul.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>PLASTIC CONSTRUCTION</p>


<div class="sidenote">Automatic expression often leaves traces in the outer world.</div>

<p>We have seen how arts founded on exercise and automatic self-expression
develop into music, poetry, and prose. By an indirect approach they come
to represent outer conditions, till they are interwoven in a life which
has in some measure gone out to meet its opportunities and learned to
turn them to an ideal use. We have now to see how man's reactive habits
pass simultaneously into art in a wholly different region. Spontaneous
expression, such as song, comes when internal growth in an animal system
vents itself, as it were, by the way. At the same time animal economy
has playful manifestations concerned with outer things, such as
burrowing or collecting objects. These practices are not less
spontaneous than the others, and no less expressive; but they seem more
external because the traces they leave on the environment are more
clearly marked.</p>

<p>To change an object is the surest and most glorious way of changing a
perception. A shift in posture may relieve the body, and in that way
satisfy, <a name="Page_117" id="Page_117" />but the new attitude is itself unstable. Its pleasantness,
like its existence, is transient, and scarcely is a movement executed
when both its occasion and its charm are forgotten. Self-expression by
exercise, in spite of its pronounced automatism, is therefore something
comparatively passive and inglorious. A man has hardly <i>done</i> anything
when he has laughed or yawned. Even the inspired poet retains something
of this passivity: his work is not his, but that of a restless,
irresponsible spirit passing through him, and hypnotising him for its
own ends. Of the result he has no profit, no glory, and little
understanding. So the mystic also positively gloats on his own
nothingness, and puts his whole genuine being in a fancied
instrumentality and subordination to something else. Far more virile and
noble is the sense of having actually done something, and left at least
the temporary stamp of one's special will on the world. To chop a stick,
to catch a fly, to pile a heap of sand, is a satisfying action; for the
sand stays for a while in its novel arrangement, proclaiming to the
surrounding level that we have made it our instrument, while the fly
will never stir nor the stick grow together again in all eternity. If
the impulse that has thus left its indelible mark on things is constant
in our own bosom, the world will have been permanently improved and
humanised by our action. Nature cannot but be more favourable to those
ideas which have once found an efficacious champion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118" />Such effects fruitful.</div>

<p>Plastic impulses find in this way an immediate sanction in the sense of
victory and dominion which they carry with them; it is so evident a
proof of power in ourselves to see things and animals bent out of their
habitual form and obedient instead to our idea. But a far weightier
sanction immediately follows. Man depends on things for his experience,
yet by automatic action he changes these very things so that it becomes
possible that by his action he should promote his welfare. He may, of
course, no less readily precipitate his ruin. The animal is more subject
to vicissitudes than the plant, which makes no effort to escape them or
to give chase to what it feeds upon. The greater perils of action,
however, are in animals covered partly by fertility, partly by
adaptability, partly by success. The mere possibility of success, in a
world governed by natural selection, is an earnest of progress.
Sometimes, in impressing the environment, a man will improve it: which
is merely to say that a change may sometimes fortify the impulse which
brought it about. As soon as this retroaction is perceived and the act
is done with knowledge of its ensuing benefits, plastic impulse becomes
art, and the world begins actually to change in obedience to reason.</p>

<p>One respect, for instance, in which man depends on things is for the
&aelig;sthetic quality of his perceptions. If he happens, by a twist of the
hand, to turn a flowering branch into a wreath, thereby <a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" />making it more
interesting, he will have discovered a decorative art and initiated
himself auspiciously into the practice of it. Experimentation may
follow, and whenever the new form given to the object improves
it&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, increases its interest for the eye&mdash;the experimenter will
triumph and will congratulate himself on his genius. The garland so
arranged will be said to express the taste it satisfies; insight and
reason will be mythically thought to have guided the work by which they
are sustained in being. It is no small harmony, however, that they
should be sustained by it. The consonances man introduces into nature
will follow him wherever he goes. It will no longer be necessary that
nature should supply them spontaneously, by a rare adventitious harmony
with his demands. His new habit will habitually rear-range her chance
arrangements, and his path will be marked by the beauties he has strewn
it with. So long as the same plastic impulse continues operative it will
be accompanied by knowledge and criticism of its happy results.
Self-criticism, being a second incipient artistic impulse, contrasting
itself with the one which a work embodies, may to some extent modify the
next performance. If life is drawn largely into this deepening channel,
physical proficiency and its ideal sanctions will develop more or less
harmoniously into what is called a school of art.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic authority of man's first creations.</div>

<p>The first felt utilities by which plastic instinct is sanctioned are of
course not distinctly &aelig;sthetic, <a name="Page_120" id="Page_120" />much less distinctly practical; they
are magical. A stone cut into some human or animal semblance fascinates
the savage eye much more than would a useful tool or a beautiful idol.
The man wonders at his own work, and petrifies the miracle of his art
into miraculous properties in its product. Primitive art is incredibly
conservative; its first creations, having once attracted attention,
monopolise it henceforth and nothing else will be trusted to work the
miracle. It is a sign of stupidity in general to stick to physical
objects and given forms apart from their ideal functions, as when a
child cries for a broken doll, even if a new and better one is at hand
to replace it. Inert associations establish themselves, in such a case,
with that part of a thing which is irrelevant to its value&mdash;its material
substance or perhaps its name. Art can make no progress in such a
situation. A man remains incorrigibly unhappy and perplexed, cowed, and
helpless, because not intelligent enough to readjust his actions; his
idol must be the self-same hereditary stock, or at least it must have
the old sanctified rigidity and stare. Plastic impulse, as yet sporadic,
is overwhelmed by a brute idolatrous awe at mere existence and
actuality. What is, what has always been, what chance has associated
with one person, alone seems acceptable or conceivable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Art brings relief from idolatry.</div>

<p>Idolatry is by no means incident to art; art, on the contrary, is a
release from idolatry. A <a name="Page_121" id="Page_121" />cloud, an animal, a spring, a stone, or the
whole heaven, will serve the pure idolater's purpose to perfection;
these things have existence and a certain hypnotic power, so that he may
make them a focus for his dazed contemplation. When the mind takes to
generalities it finds the same fascination in Being or in the Absolute,
something it needs no art to discover. The more indeterminate,
immediate, and unutterable the idol is, the better it induces panic
self-contraction and a reduction of all discourse to the infinite
intensity of zero. When idolaters pass from trying to evoke the
Absolutely Existent to apostrophising the sun or an ithyphallic bull
they have made an immense progress in art and religion, for now their
idols represent some specific and beneficent function in nature,
something propitious to ideal life and to its determinate expression.
Isaiah is very scornful of idols made with hands, because they have no
physical energy. He forgets that perhaps they represent something, and
so have a spiritual dignity which things living and powerful never have
unless they too become representative and express some ideal. Isaiah's
conception of Jehovah, for instance, is itself a poetic image, the work
of man's brain; and the innocent worship of it would not be idolatry, if
that conception represented something friendly to human happiness and to
human art. The question merely is whether the sculptor's image or the
prophet's stands for the greater interest and is a more ade<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" />quate symbol
for the good. The noblest art will be the one, whether plastic or
literary or dialectical, which creates figments most truly
representative of what is momentous in human life. Similarly the least
idolatrous religion would be the one which used the most perfect art,
and most successfully abstracted the good from the real.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inertia in technique.</div>

<p>Conservatism rules also in those manufactures which are tributary to
architecture and the smaller plastic arts. Utility makes small headway
against custom, not only when custom has become religion, but even when
it remains inert and without mythical sanction. To admit or trust
anything new is to overcome that inertia which is a general law in the
brain no less than elsewhere, and which may be distinguished in
reflection into a technical and a social conservatism. Technical
conservatism appears, for instance, in a man's handwriting, which is so
seldom improved, even when admitted, perhaps, to be execrable. Every
artist has his tricks of execution, every school its hereditary,
irrational processes. These refractory habits are to blame for the rare
and inimitable quality of genius; they impose excellence on one man and
refuse it to a million. A happy physiological structure, by creating a
mannerism under the special circumstances favourable to expression, may
lift a man, perhaps inferior in intelligence, to heights which no
insight can attain with inferior organs. As a voice is necessary for
singing, so a certain quickness of eye and hand <a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" />is needed for good
execution in the plastic arts. The same principle goes deeper.
Conception and imagination are themselves automatic and run in grooves,
so that only certain forms in certain combinations will ever suggest
themselves to a given designer. Every writer's style, too, however
varied within limits, is single and monotonous compared with the ideal
possibilities of expression. Genius at every moment is confined to the
idiom it is creating.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inertia in appreciation.</div>

<p>Social inertia is due to the same causes working in the community at
large. The fancy, for instance, of building churches in the shape of a
cross has largely determined Christian architecture. Builders were
prevented by a foregone suggestion in themselves and by their patrons'
demands from conceiving any alternative to that convention. Early
pottery, they say, imitates wicker-work, and painted landscape was for
ages not allowed to exist without figures, although even the old masters
show plainly enough in their backgrounds that they could love landscape
for its own sake. When one link with humanity has been rendered explicit
and familiar, people assume that by no other means can humanity be
touched at all; even if at the same time their own heart is expanding to
the highest raptures in a quite different region. The severer Greeks
reprobated music without words; Saint Augustine complained of chants
that rendered the sacred text unintelligible; the Puritans regarded
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" />elaborate music as diabolical, little knowing how soon some of their
descendants would find religion in nothing else. A stupid convention
still looks on material and mathematical processes as somehow
distressing and ugly, and systems of philosophy, artificially
mechanical, are invented to try to explain natural mechanism away;
whereas in no region can the spirit feel so much at home as among
natural causes, or realise so well its universal affinities, or so
safely enlarge its happiness. Mechanism is the source of beauty. It is
not necessary to look so high as the stars to perceive this truth: the
action of an animal's limbs or the movement of a waterfall will prove it
to any one who has eyes and can shake himself loose from verbal
prejudices, those debris of old perceptions which choke all fresh
perception in the soul. Irrational hopes, irrational shames, irrational
decencies, make man's chief desolation. A slight knocking of fools'
heads together might be enough to break up the ossifications there and
start the blood coursing again through possible channels. Art has an
infinite range; nothing shifts so easily as taste and yet nothing so
persistently avoids the directions in which it might find most
satisfaction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adventitious effects appreciated first.</div>

<p>Since construction grows rational slowly and by indirect pressure, we
may expect that its most superficial merits will be the first
appreciated. Ultimate beauty in a building would consist, of course, in
responding simultaneously to all the human faculties <a name="Page_125" id="Page_125" />affected: to the
eye, by the building's size, form, and colour; to the imagination, by
its fitness and ideal expression. Of all grounds for admiration those
most readily seized are size, elaboration, splendour of materials, and
difficulties or cost involved. Having built or dug in the conventional
way a man may hang before his door some trophy of battle or the chase,
bearing witness to his prowess; just as people now, not thinking of
making their rooms beautiful, fill them with photographs of friends or
places they have known, to suggest and reburnish in their minds their
interesting personal history, which even they, unstimulated, might tend
to forget. That dwelling will seem best adorned which contains most
adventitious objects; bare and ugly will be whatever is not concealed by
something else. Again, a barbarous architect, without changing his
model, may build in a more precious material; and his work will be
admired for the evidence it furnishes of wealth and wilfulness. As a
community grows luxurious and becomes accustomed to such display, it may
come to seem strange and hideous to see a wooden plate or a pewter
spoon. A beautiful house will need to be in marble and the sight of
plebeian brick will banish all satisfaction.</p>

<p>Less irrational, and therefore less vulgar, is the wonder aroused by
great bulk or difficulty in the work. Exertions, to produce a great
result, even if it be material, must be allied to perseverance and
intelligent direction. Roman bridges and <a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" />aqueducts, for instance, gain
a profound emotional power when we see in their monotonous arches a
symbol of the mightiest enterprise in history, and in their decay an
evidence of its failure. Curiosity is satisfied, historic imagination is
stimulated, tragic reflection is called forth. We cannot refuse
admiration to a work so full of mind, even if no great plastic beauty
happens to distinguish it. It is at any rate beautiful enough, like the
sea or the skeleton of a mountain. We may rely on the life it has made
possible to add more positive charms and clothe it with imaginative
functions. Modern engineering works often have a similar value; the
force and intelligence they express merge in an &aelig;sthetic essence, and
the place they hold in a portentous civilisation lends them an almost
epic dignity. New York, since it took to doing business in towers, has
become interesting to look at from the sea; nor is it possible to walk
through the overshadowed streets without feeling a pleasing wonder. A
city, when enough people swarm in it, is as fascinating as an ant-hill,
and its buildings, whatever other charms they may have, are at least as
curious and delightful as sea-shells or birds' nests. The purpose of
improvements in modern structures may be economic, just as the purpose
of castles was military; but both may incidentally please the
contemplative mind by their huge forms and human associations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Approach to beauty through useful structure.</div>

<p>Of the two approaches which barbaric architecture makes to beauty&mdash;one
through ornamenta<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127" />tion and the other through mass&mdash;the latter is in
general the more successful. An engineer fights with nature hand to
hand: he is less easily extravagant than a decorator; he can hardly ever
afford to be absurd. He becomes accordingly more rapidly civilised and
his work acquires, in spite of itself, more rationality and a more
permanent charm. A self-sustaining structure, in art as in life, is the
only possible basis for a vital ideal. When the framework is determined,
when it is tested by trial and found to stand and serve, it will
gradually ingratiate itself with the observer; affinities it may have in
his memory or apperceptive habits will come to light; they will help him
to assimilate the new vision and will define its &aelig;sthetic character.
Whatever beauty its lines may have will become a permanent possession
and whatever beauties they exclude will be rejected by a faithful
artist, no matter how sorely at first they may tempt him. Not that these
excluded beauties would not be really beautiful; like fashions, they
would truly please in their day and very likely would contain certain
absolute excellences of form or feeling which an attentive eye could
enjoy at any time. Yet if appended to a structure they have no function
in, these excellences will hardly impose themselves on the next builder.
Being adventitious they will remain optional, and since fancy is quick,
and exotic beauties are many, there will be no end to the variations, in
endless direc<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128" />tions, which art will undergo. Caprice will follow caprice
and no style will be developed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Failure of adapted styles.</div>

<p>A settled style is perhaps in itself no desideratum. A city that should
be a bazaar of all possible architectures, adding a multitude of new
inventions to samples of every historical style, might have a certain
interest; yet carnival can hardly be enjoyed all the year round and
there is a certain latent hideousness in masquerades in spite of their
glitter. Not only are the effects juxtaposed incongruous, but each apart
is usually shallow and absurd. A perruque cannot bring back courtly
manners, and a style of architecture, when revived, is never quite
genuine; adaptations have to be introduced and every adaptation, the
bolder it is, runs the greater risk of being extravagant. Nothing is
more pitiable than the attempts people make, who think they have an
exquisite sensibility, to live in a house all of one period. The
connoisseur, like an uncritical philosopher, boasts to have patched his
dwelling perfectly together, but he has forgotten himself, its egregious
inhabitant. Nor is he merely a blot in his own composition; his presence
secretly infects and denaturalises everything in it. Ridiculous himself
in such a setting, he makes it ridiculous too by his &aelig;sthetic pose and
appreciations; for the objects he has collected or reproduced were once
used and prized in all honesty, when life and inevitable tradition had
brought them forth, while now they are studied and exhibited, relics of
a dead <a name="Page_129" id="Page_129" />past and evidences of a dead present. Historic remains and
restorations might well be used as one uses historic knowledge, to serve
some living interest and equip the mind for the undertakings of the
hour. An artist may visit a museum but only a pedant can live there.
Ideas that have long been used may be used still, if they remain ideas
and have not been congealed into memories. Incorporated into a design
that calls for them, traditional forms cease to be incongruous, as words
that still have a felt meaning may be old without being obsolete. All
depends on men subserving an actual ideal and having so firm and genuine
an appreciation of the past as to distinguish at once what is still
serviceable in it from what is already ghostly and dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Not all structure beautiful, nor all beauty structural.</div>

<p>An artist may be kept true to his style either by ignorance of all
others or by love of his own. This fidelity is a condition of progress.
When he has learned to appreciate whatever is &aelig;sthetically appreciable
in his problem, he can go on to refine his construction, to ennoble, and
finally to decorate it. As fish, flesh, and fowl have specific forms,
each more or less beautiful and adorned, so every necessary structure
has its specific character and its essential associations. Taking his
cue from these, an artist may experiment freely; he may emphasise the
structure in the classic manner and turn its lines into ornament, adding
only what may help to complete and unite its suggestions. <a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" />This
puritanism in design is rightly commended, but its opposite may be
admirable too. We may admit that nudity is the right garment for the
gods, but it would hardly serve the interests of beauty to legislate
that all mortals should always go naked. The veil that conceals natural
imperfections may have a perfection of its own. Maxims in art are
pernicious; beauty is here the only commandment. And beauty is a free
natural gift. When it has appeared, we may perceive that its influence
is rational, since it both expresses and fosters a harmony of
impressions and impulses in the soul; but to take any mechanism
whatever, and merely because it is actual or necessary to insist that it
is worth exhibiting, and that by divine decree it shall be pronounced
beautiful, is to be quite at sea in moral philosophy.</p>

<p>Beauty is adventitious, occasional, incidental, in human products no
less than in nature. Works of art are automatic figments which nature
fashions through man. It is impossible they should be wholly beautiful,
as it is impossible that they should offer no foothold or seed-plot for
beauty at all. Beauty is everywhere potential and in a way pervasive
because existence itself presupposes a modicum of harmony, first within
the thing and then between the thing and its environment. Of this
environment the observer's senses are in this case an important part.
Man can with difficulty maintain senses quite out of key with the
stimuli furnished by the outer world. They would then be useless
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131" />burdens to his organism. On the other side, even artificial structures
must be somehow geometrical or proportional, because only such
structures hold physically together. Objects that are to be esteemed by
man must further possess or acquire some function in his economy;
otherwise they would not be noticed nor be so defined as to be
recognisable. Out of these physical necessities beauty may grow; but an
adjustment must first take place between the material stimulus and the
sense it affects. Beauty is something spiritual and, being such, it
rests not on the material constitution of each existence taken apart,
but on their conspiring ideally together, so that each furthers the
other's endeavour. Structure by itself is no more beautiful than
existence by itself is good. They are only potentialities or conditions
of excellence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Structures designed for display.</div>

<p>An architect, when his main structure is uninteresting, may have
recourse to a subsidiary construction. The fa&ccedil;ade, or a part of it, or
the interior may still have a natural form that lends itself to
elaboration. This beautiful feature may be developed so as to ignore or
even conceal the rest; then the visible portion may be entirely
beautiful, like the ideal human figure, though no pledges be given
concerning the anatomy within. Many an Italian palace has a false front
in itself magnificent. We may chance to observe, however, that it
overtops its backing, perhaps an amorphous rambling pile in <a name="Page_132" id="Page_132" />quite
another material. What we admire is not so much a fa&ccedil;ade as a triumphal
gateway, set up in front of the house to be its ambassador to the world,
wearing decidedly richer apparel than its master can afford at home.
This was not vanity in the Italians so much as civility to the public,
to whose taste this flattering embassy was addressed. However our moral
sense may judge the matter, it is clear that two separate monuments
occupied the architect in such cases, if indeed inside and outside were
actually designed by the same hand. Structure may appear in each
independently and may be frankly enough expressed. The most beautiful
fa&ccedil;ades, even if independent of their building, are buildings
themselves, and since their construction is decorative there is the
greater likelihood that their decoration should be structural.</p>

<p>In relation to the house, however, the fa&ccedil;ade in such an extreme case
would be an abstract ornament; and so, though the ornament be structural
within its own lines, we have reverted to the style of building where
construction is one thing and decoration another. Applied ornament has
an indefinite range and there would be little profit in reasoning about
it. Philosophy can do little more at this point than expose the
fallacies into which dogmatic criticism is apt to fall. Everything is
true decoration which truly adorns, and everything adorns which enriches
the impression and pleasantly entertains the eye. There is a decorative
im<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133" />pulse as well as a sense for decoration. As I sit idle my stick makes
meaningless marks upon the sand; or (what is nearer to the usual origin
of ornament) I make a design out of somebody's initials, or symbolise
fantastically something lying in my thoughts. We place also one thing
upon another, the better to see and to think of two things at once.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appeal made by decoration.</div>

<p>To love decoration is to enjoy synthesis: in other words, it is to have
hungry senses and unused powers of attention. This hunger, when it
cannot well be fed by recollecting things past, relishes a profusion of
things simultaneous. Nothing is so much respected by unintelligent
people as elaboration and complexity. They are simply dazed and overawed
at seeing at once so much more than they can master. To overwhelm the
senses is, for them, the only way of filling the mind. It takes
cultivation to appreciate in art, as in philosophy, the consummate value
of what is simple and finite, because it has found its pure function and
ultimate import in the world. What is just, what is delicately and
silently adjusted to its special office, and thereby in truth to all
ultimate issues, seems to the vulgar something obvious and poor. What
astonishes them is the crude and paradoxical jumble of a thousand
suggestions in a single view. As the mystic yearns for an infinitely
glutted consciousness that feels everything at once and is not put to
the inconvenience of any longer thinking or imagining, so <a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" />the barbarian
craves the assault of a myriad sensations together, and feels replete
and comfortable when a sort of infinite is poured into him without ideal
mediation. As ideal mediation is another name for intelligence, so it is
the condition of elegance. Intelligence and elegance naturally exist
together, since they both spring from a subtle sense for absent and
eventual processes. They are sustained by experience, by nicety in
foretaste and selection. Before ideality, however, is developed, volume
and variety must be given bodily or they cannot be given at all. At that
earlier stage a furious ornamentation is the chief vehicle for beauty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its natural rights.</div>

<p>That the ornate may be very beautiful, that in fact what is to be
completely beautiful needs to be somehow rich, is a fact of experience
which further justifies the above analysis. For sensation is the matter
of ideas; all representation is such only in its function; in its
existence it remains mere feeling. Decoration, by stimulating the
senses, not only brings a primary satisfaction with it, independent of
any that may supervene, but it furnishes an element of effect which no
higher beauty can ever render unwelcome or inappropriate, since any
higher beauty, in moving the mind, must give it a certain sensuous and
emotional colouring. Decoration is accordingly an independent art, to be
practised for its own sake, in obedience to elementary plastic
instincts. It is fundamental in <a name="Page_135" id="Page_135" />design, for everything structural or
significant produces in the first instance some sensuous impression and
figures as a spot or pattern in the field of vision. The fortunate
architect is he who has, for structural skeleton in his work, a form in
itself decorative and beautiful, who can carry it out in a beautiful
material, and who finally is suffered to add so much decoration as the
eye may take in with pleasure, without losing the expression and
lucidity of the whole.</p>

<p>It is impossible, however, to imagine beforehand what these elements
should be or how to combine them. The problem must exist before its
solution can be found. The forms of good taste and beauty which a man
can think of or esteem are limited by the scope of his previous
experience. It would be impossible to foresee or desire a beauty which
had not somehow grown up of itself and been recognised receptively. A
satisfaction cannot be conceived ideally when neither its organ nor its
occasion has as yet arisen. That ideal conception, to exist, would have
to bring both into play. The fine arts are butter to man's daily bread;
there is no conceiving or creating them except as they spring out of
social exigencies. Their types are imposed by utility: their
ornamentation betrays the tradition that happens to envelop and
diversify them; their expression and dignity are borrowed from the
company they keep in the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its alliance with structure in Greek architecture.</div>

<p>The Greek temple, for instance, if we imagine it in its glory, with all
its colour and furniture, <a name="Page_136" id="Page_136" />was a type of human art at its best, where
decoration, without in the least restricting itself, took naturally an
exquisitely subordinate and pervasive form: each detail had its own
splendour and refinement, yet kept its place in the whole. Structure and
decoration were alike traditional and imposed by ulterior practical or
religious purposes; yet, by good fortune and by grace of that
rationality which unified Greek life, they fell together easily into a
harmony such as imagination could never have devised had it been invited
to decree pleasure-domes for non-existent beings. Had the Greek gods
been hideous, their images and fable could not so readily have
beautified the place where they were honoured; and had the structural
theme and uses of the temple been more complicated, they would not have
lent themselves so well to decoration without being submerged beneath
it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relations of the two in Gothic art.</div>

<p>In some ways the ideal Gothic church attained a similar perfection,
because there too the structure remained lucid and predominant, while it
was enriched by many necessary appointments&mdash;altars, stalls, screens,
chantries&mdash;which, while really the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the whole edifice,
&aelig;sthetically regarded, served for its ornaments. It may be doubted,
however, whether Gothic construction was well grounded enough in utility
to be a sound and permanent basis for beauty; and the extreme
instability of Gothic style, the feverish, inconstancy of architects
straining after effects <a name="Page_137" id="Page_137" />never, apparently, satisfactory when achieved,
shows that something was wrong and artificial in the situation. The
structure, in becoming an ornament, ceased to be anything else and could
be discarded by any one whose fancy preferred a different image.</p>

<p>For this reason a building like the cathedral of Amiens, where a
structural system is put through consistently, is far from representing
medi&aelig;val art in its full and ideal essence; it is rather an incidental
achievement, a sport in which an adventitious interest is, for a moment,
emphasised overwhelmingly. Intelligence here comes to the fore, and a
sort of mathematical virtuosity: but it was not mathematical virtuosity
nor even intelligence to which, in Christian art, the leading r&ocirc;le
properly belonged. What structural elucidation did for church
architecture was much like what scholastic elucidation did for church
dogma: it insinuated a logic into the traditional edifice which was far
from representing its soul or its genuine value. The dialectic
introduced might be admirable in itself, in its lay and abstruse
rationality; but it could not be applied to the poetic material in hand
without rendering it absurd and sterile. The given problem was
scientifically carried out, but the given problem was itself fantastic.
To vault at such heights and to prop that vault with external buttresses
was a gratuitous undertaking. The result was indeed interesting, the
ingenuity and method exhibited were masterly in their way; <a name="Page_138" id="Page_138" />yet the
result was not proportionate in beauty to the effort required; it was
after all a technical and a vain triumph.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The result here romantic.</div>

<p>The true magic of that very architecture lay not in its intelligible
structure but in the bewildering incidental effects which that structure
permitted. The part in such churches is better than the symmetrical
whole; often incompleteness and accretions alone give grace or
expression, to the monument. A cross vista where all is wonder, a side
chapel where all is peace, strike the key-note here; not that
punctilious and wooden repetition of props and arches, as a builder's
model might boast to exhibit them. Perhaps the most beautiful Gothic
interiors are those without aisles, if what we are considering is their
proportion and majesty; elsewhere the structure, if perceived at all, is
too artificial and strange to be perceived intuitively and to have the
glow of a genuine beauty. There is an over-ingenious mechanism, redeemed
by its colour and the thousand intervening objects, when these have not
been swept away. Glazed and painted as Gothic churches were meant to be,
they were no doubt exceedingly gorgeous. When we admire their structural
scheme we are perhaps nursing an illusion like that which sentimental
classicists once cherished when they talked about the purity of white
marble statues and the ideality of their blank and sightless eyes. What
we treat as a supreme quality may have been a mere means to medi&aelig;val
builders, and a mechani<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139" />cal expedient: their simple hearts were set on
making their churches, for God's glory and their own, as large, as high,
and as rich as possible. After all, an uninterrupted tradition attached
them to Byzantium; and it was the sudden passion for stained glass and
the goldsmith's love of intricate fineness&mdash;which the Saracens also had
shown&mdash;that carried them in a century from Romanesque to flamboyant. The
structure was but the inevitable underpinning for the desired display.
If these sanctuaries, in their spoliation and ruin, now show us their
admirable bones, we should thank nature for that rational skeleton,
imposed by material conditions on an art which in its life-time was
goaded on only by a pious and local emulation, and wished at all costs
to be sumptuous and astonishing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The medi&aelig;val artist.</div>

<p>It was rather in another direction that groping medi&aelig;val art reached its
most congenial triumphs. That was an age, so to speak, of epidemic
privacy; social contagion was irresistible, yet it served only to make
each man's life no less hard, narrow, and visionary than that of every
one else. Like bees in a hive, each soul worked in its separate cell by
the same impulse as every other. Each was absorbed in saving itself
only, but according to a universal prescription. This isolation in
unanimity appears in those patient and childlike artists who copied each
his leaf or flower, or imagined each his curious angels and devils,
taking what was told of them so much <a name="Page_140" id="Page_140" />to heart that his rendering became
deeply individual. The lamp of sacrifice&mdash;or perhaps rather of
ignorance&mdash;burned in every workshop; much labour was wasted in
forgetfulness of the function which the work was to perform, yet a
certain pathos and expression was infused into the detail, on which all
invention and pride had to be lavished. Carvings and statues at
impossible elevations, minute symbols hidden in corners, the choice for
architectural ornament of animal and vegetable forms, copied as
attentively and quaintly as possible&mdash;all this shows how abstractedly
the artist surrendered himself to the given task. He dedicated his
genius like the widow's mite, and left the universal composition to
Providence.</p>

<p>Nor was this humility, on another side, wholly pious and sacrificial.
The Middle Ages were, in their way, merry, sturdy, and mischievous. A
fresh breath, as of convalescence, breathed through their misery. Never
was spring so green and lovely as when men greeted it in a cloistered
garden, with hearts quite empty and clean, only half-awakened from a
long trance of despair. It mattered little at such a moment where a work
was to figure or whether any one should ever enjoy it. The pleasure and
the function lay here, in this private revelation, in this playful
dialogue between a bit of nature and a passing mood. When a Greek
workman cut a volute or a moulding, he was not asked to be a poet; he
was merely a scribe, writing out what some master had composed before
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141" />him. The spirit of his art, if that was called forth consciously at
all, could be nothing short of intelligence. Those lines and none other,
he would say to himself, are requisite and sufficient: to do less would
be unskilful, to do more would be perverse. But the medi&aelig;val craftsman
was irresponsible in his earnestness. The whole did not concern him, for
the whole was providential and therefore, to the artist, irrelevant. He
was only responsible inwardly, to his casual inspiration, to his
individual model, and his allotted block of stone. With these he carried
on, as it were, an ingenuous dialectic, asking them questions by a blow
of the hammer, and gathering their oracular answers experimentally from
the result. Art, like salvation, proceeded by a series of little
miracles; it was a blind work, half stubborn patience, half unmerited
grace. If the product was destined to fill a niche in the celestial
edifice, that was God's business and might be left to him: what
concerned the sculptor was to-day's labour and joy, with the shrewd
wisdom they might bring after them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Representation introduced.</div>

<p>Gothic ornament was accordingly more than ornament; it was sculpture. To
the architect sculpture and painting are only means of variegating a
surface; light and shade, depth and elaboration, are thereby secured and
aid him in distributing his masses. For this reason geometrical or
highly conventionalised ornament is all the architect requires. If his
decorators furnish more, if they insist on copying natural <a name="Page_142" id="Page_142" />forms or
illustrating history, that is their own affair. Their humanity will
doubtless give them, as representative artists, a new claim on human
regard, and the building they enrich in their pictorial fashion will
gain a new charm, just as it would gain by historic associations or by
the smell of incense clinging to its walls. When the arts superpose
their effects the total impression belongs to none of them in
particular; it is imaginative merely or in the broadest sense poetical.
So the monumental function of Greek sculpture, and the interpretations
it gave to national myths, made every temple a storehouse of poetic
memories. In the same way every great cathedral became a pious
story-book. Construction, by admitting applied decoration, offers a
splendid basis and background for representative art. It is in their
decorative function that construction and representation meet; they are
able to conspire in one ideal effect by virtue of the common appeal
which they unwittingly make to the senses. If construction were not
decorative it could never ally itself imaginatively to decoration; and
decoration in turn would never be willingly representative if the forms
which illustration requires were not decorative in themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transition to illustration.</div>

<p>Illustration has nevertheless an intellectual function by which it
diverges altogether from decoration and even, in the narrowest sense of
the word, from art: for the essence of illustration lies neither in use
nor in beauty. The illustrator's <a name="Page_143" id="Page_143" />impulse is to reproduce and describe
given objects. He wishes in the first place to force
observers&mdash;overlooking all logical scruples&mdash;to call his work by the
name of its subject matter; and then he wishes to inform them further,
through his representation, and to teach them to apprehend the real
object as, in its natural existence, it might never have been
apprehended. His first task is to translate the object faithfully into
his special medium; his second task, somewhat more ambitious, is so to
penetrate into the object during that process of translation that this
translation may become at the same time analytic and imaginative, in
that it signalises the object's structure and emphasises its ideal
suggestions. In such reproduction both hand and mind are called upon to
construct and build up a new apparition; but here construction has
ceased to be chiefly decorative or absolute in order to become
representative. The &aelig;sthetic element in art has begun to recede before
the intellectual; and sensuous effects, while of course retained and
still studied, seem to be impressed into the service of ideas.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>PLASTIC REPRESENTATION</p>


<div class="sidenote">Psychology of imitation.</div>

<p>Imitation is a fertile principle in the Life of Reason. We have seen
that it furnishes the only rational sanction for belief in any fellow
mind; now we shall see how it creates the most glorious and interesting
of plastic arts. The machinery of imitation is obscure but its
prevalence is obvious, and even in the present rudimentary state of
human biology we may perhaps divine some of its general features. In a
motor image the mind represents prophetically what the body is about to
execute: but all images are more or less motor, so that no idea,
apparently, can occupy the mind unless the body has received some
impulse to enact the same. The plastic instinct to reproduce what is
seen is therefore simply an uninterrupted and adequate seeing; these two
phenomena, separable logically and divided in Cartesian psychology by an
artificial chasm, are inseparable in existence and are, for natural
history, two parts of the same event. That an image should exist for
consciousness is, abstractly regarded, a fact which neither involves
motion nor constitutes knowledge; but that natural relation <a name="Page_145" id="Page_145" />to ulterior
events which endows that image with a cognitive function identifies it
at the same time with the motor impulse which accompanies the idea. If
the image involved no bodily attitude and prophesied no action it would
refer to no eventual existence and would have no practical meaning. Even
if it <i>meant</i> to refer to something ulterior it would, under those
circumstances, miss its aim, seeing that no natural relation connected
it with any object which could support or verify its asseverations. It
might <i>feel</i> significant, like a dream, but its significance would be
vain and not really self-transcendent; for it is in the world of events
that logic must find application, if it cares for applicability at all.
This needful bond between ideas and the further existences they forebode
is not merely a logical postulate, taken on trust because the ideas in
themselves assert it; it is a previous and genetic bond, proper to the
soil in which the idea flourishes and a condition of its existence. For
the idea expresses unawares a present cerebral event of which the
ulterior event consciously looked to is a descendant or an ancestor; so
that the ripening of that idea, or its prior history, leads materially
to the fact which the idea seeks to represent ideally.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sustained sensation involves reproduction.</div>

<p>In some such fashion we may come to conceive how imitative art is simply
the perfection and fulfilment of sensation. The act of apperception in
which a sensation is reflected upon and understood is already an
internal reproduction. The <a name="Page_146" id="Page_146" />object is retraced and gone over in the
mind, not without quite perceptible movements in the limbs, which sway,
as it were, in sympathy with the object's habit. Presumably this
incipient imitation of the object is the physical basis for apperception
itself; the stimulus, whatever devious courses it may pursue,
reconstitutes itself into an impulse to render the object again, as we
acquire the accent which we often hear. This imitation sometimes has the
happiest results, in that the animal fights with one that fights, and
runs after one that runs away from him. All this happens initially, as
we may still observe in ourselves, quite without thought of eventual
profit; although if chase leads to contact, and contact stimulates
hunger or lust, movements important for preservation will quickly
follow. Such eventual utilities, however, like all utilities, are
supported by a prodigious gratuitous vitality, and long before a
practical or scientific use of sensation is attained its artistic force
is in full operation. If art be play, it is only because all life is
play in the beginning. Rational adjustments to truth and to benefit
supervene only occasionally and at a higher level.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Imitative art repeats with intent to repeat, and in a new
material.</div>

<p>Imitation cannot, of course, result in a literal repetition of the
object that suggests it. The copy is secondary; it does not iterate the
model by creating a second object on the same plane of reality, but
reproduces the form in a new medium and gives it a different function.
In these latter cir<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147" />cumstances lies the imitative essence of the second
image: for one leaf does not imitate another nor is each twin the
other's copy. Like sensibility, imitation remodels a given being so that
it becomes, in certain formal respects, like another being in its
environment. It is a response and an index, by which note is taken of a
situation or of its possible developments. When a man involuntarily
imitates other men, he does not become those other persons; he is simply
modified by their presence in a manner that allows him to conceive their
will and their independent existence, not without growing similar to
them in some measure and framing a genuine representation of them in his
soul. He enacts what he understands, and his understanding consists
precisely in knowing that he is re-enacting something which has its
collateral existence elsewhere in nature. An element in the percipient
repeats the total movement and tendency of the person perceived. The
imitation, though akin to what it imitates, and reproducing it, lies in
a different medium, and accordingly has a specific individuality and
specific effects. Imitation is far more than similarity, nor does its
ideal function lie in bringing a flat and unmeaning similarity about. It
has a representative and intellectual value because in reproducing the
forms of things it reproduces them in a fresh substance to a new
purpose.</p>

<p>If I imitate mankind by following their fashions, <a name="Page_148" id="Page_148" />I add one to the
million and improve nothing: but if I imitate them under proper
inhibitions and in the service of my own ends, I really understand them,
and, by representing what I do not bodily become, I preserve and enlarge
my own being and make it relevant ideally to what it physically depends
upon. Assimilation is a way of drifting through the flux or of letting
it drift through oneself; representation, on the contrary, is a
principle of progress. To grow by accumulating passions and fancies is
at best to grow in bulk: it is to become what a colony or a hydra might
be. But to make the accretions which time brings to your being
representative of what you are not, and do not wish to be, is to grow in
dignity. It is to be wise and prepared. It is to survey a universe
without ceasing to be a mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Imitation leads to adaptation and to knowledge.</div>

<p>A product of imitative sensibility is accordingly on a higher plane than
the original existences it introduces to one another&mdash;the ignorant
individual and the unknown world. Imitation in softening the body into
physical adjustment stimulates the mind to ideal representation. This is
the case even when the stimulus is a contagious influence or habit,
though the response may then be slavish and the representation vague.
Sheep jumping a wall after their leader doubtless feel that they are not
alone; and though their action may have no purpose it probably has a
felt sanction and reward. Men also think they invoke an authority <a name="Page_149" id="Page_149" />when
they appeal to the <i>quod semper et ubique et ab omnibus</i>, and a
conscious unanimity is a human if not a rational joy. When, however, the
stimulus to imitation is not so pervasive and touches chiefly a single
sense, when what it arouses is a movement of the hand or eye retracing
the object, then the response becomes very definitely cognitive. It
constitutes an observation of fact, an acquaintance with a thing's
structure amounting to technical knowledge; for such a survey leaves
behind it a power to reconstitute the process it involved. It leaves an
efficacious idea. In an idle moment, when the information thus acquired
need not be put to instant use, the new-born faculty may work itself out
spontaneously. The sound heard is repeated, the thing observed is
sketched, the event conceived is acted out in pantomime. Then imitation
rounds itself out; an uninhibited sensation has become an instinct to
keep that sensation alive, and plastic representation has begun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the artist is inspired and irresponsible.</div>

<p>The secret of representative genius is simple enough. All hangs on
intense, exhaustive, rehearsed sensation. To paint is a way of letting
vision work; nor should the amateur imagine that while he lacks
technical knowledge he can have in his possession all the ideal burden
of an art. His reaction will be personal and adventitious, and he will
miss the artist's real inspiration and ignore his genuine successes. You
may instruct a poet about literature, but his allegiance is to emotion.
You may <a name="Page_150" id="Page_150" />offer the sculptor your comparative observations on style and
taste; he may or may not care to listen, but what he knows and loves is
the human body. Critics are in this way always one stage behind or
beyond the artist; their operation is reflective and his is direct. In
transferring to his special medium what he has before him his whole mind
is lost in the object; as the marksman, to shoot straight, looks at the
mark. How successful the result is, or how appealing to human nature, he
judges afterwards, as an outsider might, and usually judges ill; since
there is no life less apt to yield a broad understanding for human
affairs or even for the residue of art itself, than the life of a man
inspired, a man absorbed, as the genuine artist is, in his own travail.
But into this travail, into this digestion and reproduction of the thing
seen, a critic can hardly enter. Having himself the ulterior office of
judge, he must not hope to rival nature's children in their sportiveness
and intuition.</p>

<p>In an age of moral confusion, these circumstances may lead to a strange
shifting of r&ocirc;les. The critic, feeling that something in the artist has
escaped him, may labour to put himself in the artist's place. If he
succeeded, the result would only be to make him a biographer; he would
be describing in words the very intuitions which the artist had rendered
in some other medium. To understand how the artist felt, however, is not
criticism; criticism is an investigation of what the <a name="Page_151" id="Page_151" />work is good for.
Its function may be chiefly to awaken certain emotions in the beholder,
to deepen in him certain habits of apperception; but even this most
&aelig;sthetic element in a work's operation does not borrow its value from
the possible fact that the artist also shared those habits and emotions.
If he did, and if they are desirable, so much the better for him; but
his work's value would still consist entirely in its power to propagate
such good effects, whether they were already present in him or not. All
criticism is therefore moral, since it deals with benefits and their
relative weight. Psychological penetration and reconstructed biography
may be excellent sport; if they do not reach historic truth they may at
least exercise dramatic talent. Criticism, on the other hand, is a
serious and public function; it shows the race assimilating the
individual, dividing the immortal from the mortal part of a soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Need of knowing and loving the subject rendered.</div>

<p>Representation naturally repeats those objects which are most
interesting in themselves. Even the medium, when a choice is possible,
is usually determined by the sort of objects to be reproduced.
Instruments lose their virtue with their use and a medium of
representation, together with its manipulation, is nothing but a
vehicle. It is fit if it makes possible a good rendition. All
accordingly hangs on what life has made interesting to the senses, on
what presents itself persuasively to the artist for imitation; and
living arts exist only while <a name="Page_152" id="Page_152" />well-known, much-loved things imperatively
demand to be copied, so that their reproduction has some honest
non-&aelig;sthetic interest for mankind. Although subject matter is often said
to be indifferent to art, and an artist, when his art is secondary, may
think of his technique only, nothing is really so poor and melancholy as
art that is interested in itself and not in its subject. If any remnant
of inspiration or value clings to such a performance, it comes from a
surviving taste for something in the real world. Thus the literature
that calls itself purely &aelig;sthetic is in truth prurient; without this
half-avowed weakness to play upon, the coloured images evoked would have
had nothing to marshall or to sustain them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Public interests determine the subject of art, and the
subject the medium.</div>

<p>A good way to understand schools and styles and to appreciate their
respective functions and successes is to consider first what region of
nature preoccupied the age in which they arose. Perception can cut the
world up into many patterns, which it isolates and dignifies with the
name of things. It must distinguish before it can reproduce and the
objects which attention distinguishes are of many strange sorts. Thus
the single man, the hero, in his acts of prowess or in his readiness,
may be the unit and standard in discourse. It will then be his image
that will preoccupy the arts. For such a task the most adequate art is
evidently sculpture, for sculpture is the most complete of imitations.
In no other art <a name="Page_153" id="Page_153" />can apprehension render itself so exhaustively and with
such recuperative force. Sculpture retains form and colour, with all
that both can suggest, and it retains them in their integrity, leaving
the observer free to resurvey them from any point of view and drink in
their quality exhaustively.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reproduction by acting ephemera.</div>

<p>The movement and speech which are wanting, the stage may be called upon
to supply; but it cannot supply them without a terrible sacrifice, for
it cannot give permanence to it expression. Acting is for this reason an
inferior art, not perhaps in difficulty and certainly not in effect, but
inferior in dignity, since the effort of art is to keep what is
interesting in existence, to recreate it in the eternal, and this ideal
is half frustrated if the representation is itself fleeting and the
rendering has no firmer subsistence than the inspiration that gave it
birth. By making himself, almost in his entirety, the medium of his art,
the actor is morally diminished, and as little of him remains in his
work, when this is good, as of his work in history. He lends himself
without interest, and after being Brutus at one moment and Falstaff at
another, he is not more truly himself. He is abolished by his creations,
which nevertheless cannot survive him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">High demands of sculpture.</div>

<p>Being so adequate a rendering of its object, sculpture demands a perfect
mastery over it and is correspondingly difficult. It requires taste and
training above every other art; for not only must the material form be
repro<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154" />duced, but its motor suggestions and moral expression must be
rendered; things which in the model itself are at best transitory, and
which may never be found there if a heroic or ideal theme is proposed.
The sculptor is obliged to have caught on the wing attitudes momentarily
achieved or vaguely imagined; yet these must grow firm and harmonious
under his hand. Nor is this enough; for sculpture is more dependent than
other arts on its model. If the statue is to be ideal, <i>i.e.</i>, if it is
to express the possible motions and vital character of its subject, the
model must itself be refined. Training must have cut in the flesh those
lines which are to make the language and eloquence of the marble.
Trivial and vulgar forms, such as modern sculpture abounds in, reflect
an undisciplined race of men, one in which neither soul nor body has
done anything well, because the two have done nothing together. The
frame has remained gross or awkward, while the face has taken on a tense
expression, betraying loose and undignified habits of mind. To carve
such a creature is to perpetuate a caricature. The modern sculptor is
stopped short at the first conception of a figure; if he gives it its
costume, it is grotesque; if he strips it, it is unmeaning and pitiful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is essentially obsolete.</div>

<p>Greece was in all these respects a soil singularly favourable to
sculpture. The success there achieved was so conspicuous that two
thousand years of essential superfluity have not availed to extirpate
the art. Plastic im<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155" />pulse is indeed immortal, and many a hand, even
without classic example, would have fallen to modelling. In the middle
ages, while monumental sculpture was still rudely reminiscent,
ornamental carving arose spontaneously. Yet at every step the
experimental sculptor would run up against disaster. What could be seen
in the streets, while it offered plenty of subjects, offered none that
could stimulate his talent. His patrons asked only for illustration and
applied ornament; his models offered only the smirk and sad humour of a
stunted life. Here and there his statues might attain a certain
sweetness and grace, such as painting might perfectly well have
rendered; but on the whole sculpture remained decorative and infantile.</p>

<p>The Renaissance brought back technical freedom and a certain
inspiration, unhappily a retrospective and exotic one. The art cut
praiseworthy capers in the face of the public, but nobody could teach
the public itself to dance. If several great temperaments, under the
auspices of fashion, could then call up a magic world in which bodies
still spoke a heroic language, that was a passing dream. Society could
not feed such an artificial passion, nor the schools transmit an
arbitrary personal style that responded to nothing permanent in social
conditions. Academies continued to offer prizes for sculpture, the nude
continued to be seen in studios, and equestrian or other rhetorical
statues continued occasionally to be erected in public squares. Heroic
sculpture, however, in <a name="Page_156" id="Page_156" />modern society, is really an anomaly and
confesses as much by being a failure. No personal talent avails to
rescue an art from laboured insignificance when it has no steadying
function in the moral world, and must waver between caprice and
convention. Where something modest and genuine peeped out was in
portraiture, and also at times in that devotional sculpture in wood
which still responded to a native interest and consequently kept its
sincerity and colour. Pious images may be feeble in the extreme, but
they have not the weakness of being merely &aelig;sthetic. The purveyor of
church wares has a stated theme; he is employed for a purpose; and if he
has enough technical resource his work may become truly beautiful: which
is not to say that he will succeed if his conceptions are without
dignity or his style without discretion. There are good <i>Mater
dolorosas</i>; there is no good <i>Sacred Heart</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When men see groups and backgrounds they are natural
painters.</div>

<p>It may happen, however, that people are not interested in subjects that
demand or allow reproduction in bulk. The isolated figure or simple
group may seem cold apart from its natural setting. In rendering an
action you may need to render its scene, if it is the circumstance that
gives it value rather than the hero. You may also wish to trace out the
action through a series of episodes with many figures. In the latter
case you might have recourse to a bas-relief, which, although durable,
is usually a thankless work; there is little in it that might not be
conveyed in a drawing with distinct<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157" />ness. As some artists, like Michael
Angelo, have carried the sculptor's spirit into painting, many more,
when painting is the prevalent and natural art, have produced carved
pictures. It may be said that any work is essentially a picture which is
conceived from a single quarter and meant to be looked at only in one
light. Objects in such a case need not be so truly apperceived and
appropriated as they would have to be in true sculpture. One aspect
suffices: the subject presented is not so much constructed as dreamt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evolution of painting.</div>

<p>The whole history of painting may be strung on this single thread&mdash;the
effort to reconstitute impressions, first the dramatic impression and
then the sensuous. A summary and symbolic representation of things is
all that at first is demanded; the point is to describe something
pictorially and recall people's names and actions. It is characteristic
of archaic painting to be quite discursive and symbolic; each figure is
treated separately and stuck side by side with the others upon a golden
ground. The painter is here smothered in the recorder, in the annalist;
only those perceptions are allowed to stand which have individual names
or chronicle facts mentioned in the story. But vision is really more
sensuous and rich than report, if art is only able to hold vision in
suspense and make it explicit. When painting is still at this stage, and
is employed on hieroglyphics, it may reach the maximum of decorative
splendour. Whatever sensuous glow finer representations may later
acquire will be not sensuous merely, <a name="Page_158" id="Page_158" />but poetical; Titians, Murillos,
or Turners are <i>colourists in representation</i>, and their canvases would
not be particularly warm or luminous if they represented nothing human
or mystical or atmospheric. A stained-glass window or a wall of tiles
can outdo them for pure colour and decorative magic. Leaving decoration,
accordingly, to take care of itself and be applied as sense may from
time to time require, painting goes on to elaborate the symbols with
which it begins, to make them symbolise more and more of what their
object contains. A catalogue of persons will fall into a group, a group
will be fused into a dramatic action. Conventional as the separate
figures may still be, their attitudes and relations will reconstitute
the dramatic impression. The event will be rendered in its own language;
it will not, to be recognised, have to appeal to words. Thus a symbolic
crucifixion is a crucifixion only because we know by report that it is;
a plastic crucifixion would first teach us, on the contrary, what a real
crucifixion might be. It only remains to supply the aerial medium and
make dramatic truth sensuous truth also.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sensuous and dramatic adequacy approached.</div>

<p>To work up a sensation intellectually and reawaken all its passionate
associations is to reach a new and more exciting sensation which we call
emotion or thought. As in poetry there are two stages, one pregnant and
prior to prose and another posterior and synthetic, so in painting we
have not <a name="Page_159" id="Page_159" />only a reversion to sense but an ulterior synthesis of the
sensuous, its interpretation in a dramatic or poetic vision. Archaic
painting, with its abstract rendering of separate things, is the prose
of design. It would not be beautiful at all but for its colour and
technical feeling&mdash;that expression of candour and satisfaction which may
pervade it, as it might a Latin rhyme. To correct this thinness and
dislocation, to restore life without losing significance, painting must
proceed to accumulate symbol upon symbol, till the original impression
is almost restored, but so restored that it contains all the
articulation which a thorough analysis had given it. Such painting as
Tintoretto's or Paolo Veronese's records impressions as a cultivated
sense might receive them. It glows with visible light and studies the
sensuous appearance, but it contains at the same time an intelligent
expression of all those mechanisms, those situations and passions, with
which the living world is diversified. It is not a design in spots,
meant merely to outdo a sunset; it is a richer dream of experience,
meant to outshine the reality.</p>

<p>In order to reconstitute the image we may take an abstract
representation or hieroglyphic and gradually increase its depth and its
scope. As the painter becomes aware of what at first he had ignored, he
adds colour to outline, modelling to colour, and finally an observant
rendering of tints and values. This process gives back to objects their
texture and atmosphere, and the space in <a name="Page_160" id="Page_160" />which they lie. From a
representation which is statuesque in feeling and which renders figures
by furnishing a visible inventory of their parts and attributes, the
artist passes to considering his figures more and more as parts of a
whole and as moving in an ambient ether. They tend accordingly to lose
their separate emphasis, in order to be like flowers in a field or trees
in a forest. They become elements, interesting chiefly by their
interplay, and shining by a light which is mutually reflected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Essence of landscape-painting.</div>

<p>When this transformation is complete the painting is essentially a
landscape. It may not represent precisely the open country; it may even
depict an interior, like Velasquez's Meninas. But the observer, even in
the presence of men and artificial objects, has been overcome by the
medium in which they swim. He is seeing the air and what it happens to
hold. He is impartially recreating from within all that nature puts
before him, quite as if his imagination had become their diffused
material substance. Whatever individuality and moral value these bits of
substance may have they acquire for him, as for nature, incidentally and
by virtue of ulterior relations consequent on their physical being. If
this physical being is wholly expressed, the humanity and morality
involved will be expressed likewise, even if expressed unawares. Thus a
profound and omnivorous reverie overflows the mind; it devours its
objects or is absorbed into them, and <a name="Page_161" id="Page_161" />the mood which this active
self-alienation brings with it is called the spirit of the scene, the
sentiment of the landscape.</p>

<p>Perception and art, in this phase, easily grow mystical; they are
readily lost in primordial physical sympathies. Although at first a
certain articulation and discursiveness may be retained in the picture,
so that the things seen in their atmosphere and relations may still be
distinguished clearly, the farther the impartial absorption in them
goes, the more what is inter-individual rises and floods the individual
over. All becomes light and depth and air, and those particular objects
threaten to vanish which we had hoped to make luminous, breathing, and
profound. The initiated eye sees so many nameless tints and surfaces,
that it can no longer select any creative limits for things. There cease
to be fixed outlines, continuous colours, or discrete existences in
nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its threatened dissolution.</div>

<p>An artist, however, cannot afford to forget that even in such a case
units and divisions would have to be introduced by him into his work. A
man, in falling back on immediate reality, or immediate appearance, may
well feel his mind's articulate grammar losing its authority, but that
grammar must evidently be reasserted if from the immediate he ever
wishes to rise again to articulate mind; and art, after all, exists for
the mind and must speak humanly. If we crave something else, we have not
so far to go: there is always <a name="Page_162" id="Page_162" />the infinite about us and the animal
within us to absolve us from human distinctions.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is not quite true that the immediate has no real diversity.
It evidently suggests the ideal terms into which we divide it, and it
sustains our apprehension itself, with all the diversities this may
create. To what I call right and left, light and darkness, a real
opposition must correspond in any reality which is at all relevant to my
experience; so that I should fail to integrate my impression, and to
absorb the only reality that concerns me, if I obliterated those points
of reference which originally made the world figured and visible. Space
remains absolutely dark, for all the infinite light which we may declare
to be radiating through it, until this light is concentrated in one body
or reflected from another; and a landscape cannot be so much as vaporous
unless mists are distinguishable in it, and through them some known
object which they obscure. In a word, landscape is always, in spite of
itself, a collection of particular representations. It is a mass of
hieroglyphics, each the graphic symbol for some definite human sensation
or reaction; only these symbols have been extraordinarily enriched and
are fused in representation, so that, like instruments in an orchestra,
they are merged in the voluminous sensation they constitute together, a
sensation in which, for attentive perception, they never cease to exist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reversion to pure decorative design.</div>

<p>Impatience of such control as reality must <a name="Page_163" id="Page_163" />always exercise over
representation may drive painting back to a simpler function. When a
designer, following his own automatic impulse, conventionalises a form,
he makes a legitimate exchange, substituting fidelity to his
apperceptive instincts for fidelity to his external impressions. When a
landscape-painter, revolting against a tedious discursive style, studies
only masses of colour and abstract systems of lines, he retains
something in itself beautiful, although no longer representative,
perhaps, of anything in nature. A pure impression cannot be
illegitimate; it cannot be false until it pretends to represent
something, and then it will have ceased to be a simple feeling, since
something in it will refer to an ulterior existence, to which it ought
to conform. This ulterior existence (since intelligence is life
understanding its own conditions) can be nothing in the end but what
produced that impression. Sensuous life, however, has its value within
itself; its pleasures are not significant. Representative art is
accordingly in a sense secondary; beauty and expression begin farther
back. They are present whenever the outer stimulus agreeably strikes an
organ and thereby arouses a sustained image, in which the consciousness
of both stimulation and reaction is embodied. An abstract design in
outline and colour will amply fulfil these conditions, if sensuous and
motor harmonies are preserved in it, and if a sufficient sweep and depth
of reaction is se<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164" />cured. Stained-glass, tapestry, panelling, and in a
measure all objects, by their mere presence and distribution, have a
decorative function. When sculpture and painting cease to be
representative they pass into the same category. Decoration in turn
merges in construction; and so all art, like the whole Life of Reason,
is joined together at its roots, and branches out from the vital
processes of sensation and reaction. Diversity arises centrifugally,
according to the provinces explored and the degree of mutual checking
and control to which the various extensions are subjected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sensuous values are primordial and so indispensable.</div>

<p>Organisation, both internal and adaptive, marks the dignity and
authority which each art may have attained; but this advantage,
important as is must seem to a philosopher or a legislator, is not what
the artist chiefly considers. His privilege is to remain capricious in
his response to the full-blown universe of science and passion, and to
be still sensuous in his highest imaginings. He cares for structure only
when it is naturally decorative. He thinks gates were invented for the
sake of triumphal arches, and forests for the sake of poets and deer.
Representation, with all it may represent, means to him simply what it
says to his emotions. In all this the artist, though in one sense
foolish, in another way is singularly sane; for, after all, everything
must pass through the senses, and life, whatever its complexity, remains
always primarily a feeling.</p>

<p><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165" />To render this feeling delightful, to train the senses to their highest
potency and harmony in operation, is to begin life well. Were the
foundations defective and subject to internal strain there could be
little soundness in the superstructure. &AElig;sthetic activity is far from
being a late or adventitious ornament in human economy; it is an
elementary factor, the perfection of an indispensable vehicle. Whenever
science or morals have done violence to sense they have decreed their
own dissolution. To sense a rebellious appeal will presently be
addressed, and the appeal will go against rash and empty dogmas. A keen
&aelig;sthetic sensibility and a flourishing art mark the puberty of reason.
Fertility comes later, after a marriage with the practical world. But a
sensuous ripening is needed first, such as myth and ornament betray in
their exuberance. A man who has no feeling for feeling and no felicity
in expression will hardly know what he is about in his further
undertakings. He will have missed his first lesson in living
spontaneously and well. Not knowing himself, he will be all hearsay and
pedantry. He may fall into the superstition of supposing that what gives
life value can be something external to life. Science and morals are
themselves arts that express natural impulses and find experimental
rewards. This fact, in betraying their analogy to &aelig;sthetic activity,
enables them also to vindicate their excellence.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>JUSTIFICATION OF ART</p>


<div class="sidenote">Art is subject to moral censorship.</div>

<p>It is no longer the fashion among philosophers to decry art. Either its
influence seems to them too slight to excite alarm, or their systems are
too lax to subject anything to censure which has the least glamour or
ideality about it. Tired, perhaps, of daily resolving the conflict
between science and religion, they prefer to assume silently a harmony
between morals and art. Moral harmonies, however, are not given; they
have to be made. The curse of superstition is that it justifies and
protracts their absence by proclaiming their invisible presence. Of
course a rational religion could not conflict with a rational science;
and similarly an art that was wholly admirable would necessarily play
into the hands of progress. But as the real difficulty in the former
case lies in saying what religion and what science would be truly
rational, so here the problem is how far extant art is a benefit to
mankind, and how far, perhaps, a vice or a burden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its initial or specific excellence is not enough.</div>

<p>That art is <i>prima facie</i> and in itself a good cannot be doubted. It is
a spontaneous activity, <a name="Page_167" id="Page_167" />and that settles the question. Yet the function
of ethics is precisely to revise <i>prima facie</i> judgments of this kind
and to fix the ultimate resultant of all given interests, in so far as
they can be combined. In the actual disarray of human life and desire,
wisdom consists in knowing what goods to sacrifice and what simples to
pour into the supreme mixture. The extent to which &aelig;sthetic values are
allowed to colour the resultant or highest good is a point of great
theoretic importance, not only for art but for general philosophy. If
art is excluded altogether or given only a trivial r&ocirc;le, perhaps as a
necessary relaxation, we feel at once that a philosophy so judging human
arts is ascetic or post-rational. It pretends to guide life from above
and from without; it has discredited human nature and mortal interests,
and has thereby undermined itself, since it is at best but a partial
expression of that humanity which it strives to transcend. If, on the
contrary, art is prized as something supreme and irresponsible, if the
poetic and mystic glow which it may bring seems its own complete
justification, then philosophy is evidently still prerational or,
rather, non-existent; for the beasts that listened to Orpheus belong to
this school.</p>

<p>To be bewitched is not to be saved, though all the magicians and
&aelig;sthetes in the world should pronounce it to be so. Intoxication is a
sad business, at least for a philosopher; for you must either <a name="Page_168" id="Page_168" />drown
yourself altogether, or else when sober again you will feel somewhat
fooled by yesterday's joys and somewhat lost in to-day's vacancy. The
man who would emancipate art from discipline and reason is trying to
elude rationality, not merely in art, but in all existence. He is vexed
at conditions of excellence that make him conscious of his own
incompetence and failure. Rather than consider his function, he
proclaims his self-sufficiency. A way foolishness has of revenging
itself is to excommunicate the world.</p>

<p>It is in the world, however, that art must find its level. It must
vindicate its function in the human commonwealth. What direct acceptable
contribution does it make to the highest good? What sacrifices, if any,
does it impose? What indirect influence does it exert on other
activities? Our answer to these questions will be our apology for art,
our proof that art belongs to the Life of Reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All satisfactions, however hurtful, have an initial worth.</div>

<p>When moralists deprecate passion and contrast it with reason, they do
so, if they are themselves rational, only because passion is so often
&quot;guilty,&quot; because it works havoc so often in the surrounding world and
leaves, among other ruins, &quot;a heart high-sorrowful and cloyed.&quot; Were
there no danger of such after-effects within and without the sufferer,
no passion would be reprehensible. Nature is innocent, and so are all
her impulses and moods when taken in isolation; it is only on meet<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169" />ing
that they blush. If it be true that matter is sinful, the logic of this
truth is far from being what the fanatics imagine who commonly propound
it. Matter is sinful only because it is insufficient, or is wastefully
distributed. There is not enough of it to go round among the legion of
hungry ideas. To embody or enact an idea is the only way of making it
actual; but its embodiment may mutilate it, if the material or the
situation is not propitious. So an infant may be maimed at birth, when
what injures him is not being brought forth, but being brought forth in
the wrong manner. Matter has a double function in respect to existence;
essentially it enables the spirit to be, yet chokes it incidentally. Men
sadly misbegotten, or those who are thwarted at every step by the times'
penury, may fall to thinking of matter only by its defect, ignoring the
material ground of their own aspirations. All flesh will seem to them
weak, except that forgotten piece of it which makes their own spiritual
strength. Every impulse, however, had initially the same authority as
this censorious one, by which the others are now judged and condemned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But, on the whole, artistic activity is innocent.</div>

<p>If a practice can point to its innocence, if it can absolve itself from
concern for a world with which it does not interfere, it has justified
itself to those who love it, though it may not yet have recommended
itself to those who do not. Now art, more than any other considerable
pursuit, more even than speculation, is abstract and inconsequential.
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170" />Born of suspended attention, it ends in itself. It encourages sensuous
abstraction, and nothing concerns it less than to influence the world.
Nor does it really do so in a notable degree. Social changes do not
reach artistic expression until after their momentum is acquired and
their other collateral effects are fully predetermined. Scarcely is a
school of art established, giving expression to prevailing sentiment,
when this sentiment changes and makes that style seem empty and
ridiculous. The expression has little or no power to maintain the
movement it registers, as a waterfall has little or no power to bring
more water down. Currents may indeed cut deep channels, but they cannot
feed their own springs&mdash;at least not until the whole revolution of
nature is taken into account.</p>

<p>In the individual, also, art registers passions without stimulating
them; on the contrary, in stopping to depict them it steals away their
life; and whatever interest and delight it transfers to their expression
it subtracts from their vital energy. This appears unmistakably in
erotic and in religious art. Though the artist's avowed purpose here be
to arouse a practical impulse, he fails in so far as he is an artist in
truth; for he then will seek to move the given passions only through
beauty, but beauty is a rival object of passion in itself. Lascivious
and pious works, when beauty has touched them, cease to give out what is
wilful and disquieting in their subject and become <a name="Page_171" id="Page_171" />altogether
intellectual and sublime. There is a high breathlessness about beauty
that cancels lust and superstition. The artist, in taking the latter for
his theme, renders them innocent and interesting, because he looks at
them from above, composes their attitudes and surroundings harmoniously,
and makes them food for the mind. Accordingly it is only in a refined
and secondary stage that active passions like to amuse themselves with
their &aelig;sthetic expression. Unmitigated lustiness and raw fanaticism will
snarl at pictures. Representations begin to interest when crude passions
recede, and feel the need of conciliating liberal interests and adding
some intellectual charm to their dumb attractions. Thus art, while by
its subject it may betray the preoccupations among which it springs up,
embodies a new and quite innocent interest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is liberal.</div>

<p>This interest is more than innocent, it is liberal. Not being concerned
with material reality so much as with the ideal, it knows neither
ulterior motives nor quantitative limits; the more beauty there is the
more there can be, and the higher one artist's imagination soars the
better the whole flock flies. In &aelig;sthetic activity we have accordingly
one side of rational life; sensuous experience is dominated there as
mechanical or social realities ought to be dominated in science and
politics. Such dominion comes of having faculties suited to their
conditions and consequently finding an inherent satisfaction <a name="Page_172" id="Page_172" />in their
operation. The justification of life must be ultimately intrinsic; and
wherever such self-justifying experience is attained, the ideal has been
in so far embodied. To have realised it in a measure helps us to realise
it further; for there is a cumulative fecundity in those goods which
come not by increase of force or matter, but by a better organisation
and form.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and typical of perfect activity.</div>

<p>Art has met, on the whole, with more success than science or morals.
Beauty gives men the best hint of ultimate good which their experience
as yet can offer; and the most lauded geniuses have been poets, as if
people felt that those seers, rather than men of action or thought, had
lived ideally and known what was worth knowing. That such should be the
case, if the fact be admitted, would indeed prove the rudimentary state
of human civilisation. The truly comprehensive life should be the
statesman's, for whom perception and theory might be expressed and
rewarded in action. The ideal dignity of art is therefore merely
symbolic and vicarious. As some people study character in novels, and
travel by reading tales of adventure, because real life is not yet so
interesting to them as fiction, or because they find it cheaper to make
their experiments in their dreams, so art in general is a rehearsal of
rational living, and recasts in idea a world which we have no present
means of recasting in reality. Yet this rehearsal reveals the glories of
a possible performance better than do the <a name="Page_173" id="Page_173" />miserable experiments until
now executed on the reality.</p>

<p>When we consider the present distracted state of government and
religion, there is much relief in turning from them to almost any art,
where what is good is altogether and finally good, and what is bad is at
least not treacherous. When we consider further the senseless rivalries,
the vanities, the ignominy that reign in the &quot;practical&quot; world, how
doubly blessed it becomes to find a sphere where limitation is an
excellence, where diversity is a beauty, and where every man's ambition
is consistent with every other man's and even favourable to it! It is
indeed so in art; for we must not import into its blameless labours the
bickerings and jealousies of criticism. Critics quarrel with other
critics, and that is a part of philosophy. With an artist no sane man
quarrels, any more than with the colour of a child's eyes. As nature,
being full of seeds, rises into all sorts of crystallisations, each
having its own ideal and potential life, each a nucleus of order and a
habitation for the absolute self, so art, though in a medium poorer than
pregnant matter, and incapable of intrinsic life, generates a semblance
of all conceivable beings. What nature does with existence, art does
with appearance; and while the achievement leaves us, unhappily, much
where we were before in all our efficacious relations, it entirely
renews our vision and breeds a fresh world in fancy, where all form has
the same inner jus<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174" />tification that all life has in the real world. As no
insect is without its rights and every cripple has his dream of
happiness, so no artistic fact, no child of imagination, is without its
small birthright of beauty. In this freer element, competition does not
exist and everything is Olympian. Hungry generations do not tread down
the ideal but only its spokesmen or embodiments, that have cast in their
lot with other material things. Art supplies constantly to contemplation
what nature seldom affords in concrete experience&mdash;the union of life and
peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ideal, when incarnate, becomes subject to civil society.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Plato's strictures: he exaggerates the effect of myths.</div>

<p>The ideal, however, would not come down from the empyrean and be
conceived unless somebody's thought were absorbed in the conception. Art
actually segregates classes of men and masses of matter to serve its
special interests. This involves expense; it impedes some possible
activities and imposes others. On this ground, from the earliest times
until our own, art has been occasionally attacked by moralists, who have
felt that it fostered idolatry or luxury or irresponsible dreams. Of
these attacks the most interesting is Plato's, because he was an artist
by temperament, bred in the very focus of artistic life and discussion,
and at the same time a consummate moral philosopher. His &aelig;thetic
sensibility was indeed so great that it led him, perhaps, into a
relative error, in that he overestimated the influence which art can
have <a name="Page_175" id="Page_175" />on character and affairs. Homer's stories about the gods can
hardly have demoralised the youths who recited them. No religion has
ever given a picture of deity which men could have imitated without the
grossest immorality. Yet these shocking representations have not had a
bad effect on believers. The deity was opposed to their own vices; those
it might itself be credited with offered no contagious example. In spite
of the theologians, we know by instinct that in speaking of the gods we
are dealing in myths and symbols. Some aspect of nature or some law of
life, expressed in an attribute of deity, is what we really regard, and
to regard such things, however sinister they may be, cannot but chasten
and moralise us. The personal character that such a function would
involve, if it were exercised willingly by a responsible being, is
something that never enters our thoughts. No such painful image comes to
perplex the plain sense of instinctive, poetic religion. To give moral
importance to myths, as Plato tended to do, is to take them far too
seriously and to belittle what they stand for. Left to themselves they
float in an ineffectual stratum of the brain. They are understood and
grow current precisely by not being pressed, like an idiom or a
metaphor. The same &aelig;sthetic sterility appears at the other end of the
scale, where fancy is anything but sacred. A Frenchman once saw in
&quot;Punch and Judy&quot; a shocking proof of British brutality, destined further
to demoralise the nation; and yet the scandal <a name="Page_176" id="Page_176" />may pass. That black
tragedy reflects not very pretty manners, but puppets exercise no
suasion over men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His deeper moral objections.</div>

<p>To his supersensitive censure of myths Plato added strictures upon music
and the drama: to excite passions idly was to enervate the soul. Only
martial or religious strains should be heard in the ideal republic.
Furthermore, art put before us a mere phantom of the good. True
excellence was the function things had in use; the horseman knew the
bridle's value and essence better than the artisan did who put it
together; but a painted bridle would lack even this relation to utility.
It would rein in no horse, and was an impertinent sensuous reduplication
of what, even when it had material being, was only an instrument and a
means.</p>

<p>This reasoning has been little understood, because Platonists so soon
lost sight of their master's Socratic habit and moral intent. They
turned the good into an existence, making it thereby unmeaning. Plato's
dialectic, if we do not thus abolish the force of its terms, is
perfectly cogent: representative art has indeed no utility, and, if the
good has been identified with efficiency in a military state, it can
have no justification. Plato's Republic was avowedly a fallen state, a
church militant, coming sadly short of perfection; and the joy which
Plato as much as any one could feel in sensuous art he postponed, as a
man in mourn<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177" />ing might, until life should be redeemed from baseness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their rightness.</div>

<p>Never have art and beauty received a more glowing eulogy than is implied
in Plato's censure. To him nothing was beautiful that was not beautiful
to the core, and he would have thought to insult art&mdash;the remodelling of
nature by reason&mdash;if he had given it a narrower field than all practice.
As an architect who had fondly designed something impossible, or which
might not please in execution, would at once erase it from the plan and
abandon it for the love of perfect beauty and perfect art, so Plato
wished to erase from pleasing appearance all that, when its operation
was completed, would bring discord into the world. This was done in the
ultimate interest of art and beauty, which in a cultivated mind are
inseparable from the vitally good. It is mere barbarism to feel that a
thing is &aelig;sthetically good but morally evil, or morally good but hateful
to perception. Things partially evil or partially ugly may have to be
chosen under stress of unfavourable circumstances, lest some worse thing
come; but if a thing were ugly it would <i>thereby</i> not be wholly good,
and if it were <i>altogether</i> good it would perforce be beautiful.</p>

<p>To criticise art on moral grounds is to pay it a high compliment by
assuming that it aims to be adequate, and is addressed to a
comprehensive mind. The only way in which art could disallow <a name="Page_178" id="Page_178" />such
criticism would be to protest its irresponsible infancy, and admit that
it was a more or less amiable blatancy in individuals, and not <i>art</i> at
all. Young animals often gambol in a delightful fashion, and men also
may, though hardly when they intend to do so. Sportive self-expression
can be prized because human nature contains a certain elasticity and
margin for experiment, in which waste activity is inevitable and may be
precious: for this license may lead, amid a thousand failures, to some
real discovery and advance. Art, like life, should be free, since both
are experimental. But it is one thing to make room for genius and to
respect the sudden madness of poets through which, possibly, some god
may speak, and it is quite another not to judge the result by rational
standards. The earth's bowels are full of all sorts of rumblings; which
of the oracles drawn thence is true can be judged only by the light of
day. If an artist's inspiration has been happy, it has been so because
his work can sweeten or ennoble the mind and because its total effect
will be beneficent. Art being a part of life, the criticism of art is a
part of morals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of &aelig;sthetic alternatives.</div>

<p>Maladjustments in human society are still so scandalous, they touch
matters so much more pressing than fine art, that maladjustments in the
latter are passed over with a smile, as if art were at any rate an
irresponsible miraculous parasite that the legislator had better not
meddle with. The day <a name="Page_179" id="Page_179" />may come, however, if the state is ever reduced to
a tolerable order, when questions of art will be the most urgent
questions of morals, when genius at last will feel responsible, and the
twist given to imagination will seem the most crucial thing in life.
Under a thin disguise, the momentous character of imaginative choices
has already been fully recognised by mankind. Men have passionately
loved their special religions, languages, and manners, and preferred
death to a life flowering in any other fashion. In justifying this
attachment forensically, with arguments on the low level of men's named
and consecrated interests, people have indeed said, and perhaps come to
believe, that their imaginative interests were material interests at
bottom, thinking thus to give them more weight and legitimacy; whereas
in truth material life itself would be nothing worth, were it not, in
its essence and its issue, ideal.</p>

<p>It was stupidly asserted, however, that if a man omitted the prescribed
ceremonies or had unauthorised dreams about the gods, he would lose his
battles in this world and go to hell in the other. He who runs can see
that these expectations are not founded on any evidence, on any
observation of what actually occurs; they are obviously a <i>mirage</i>
arising from a direct ideal passion, that tries to justify itself by
indirection and by falsehoods, as it has no need to do. We all read
facts in the way most congruous with our intellectual habit, and when
this habit drives us to effulgent <a name="Page_180" id="Page_180" />creations, absorbing and expressing
the whole current of our being, it not merely biasses our reading of
this world but carries us into another world altogether, which we posit
instead of the real one, or beside it.</p>

<p>Grotesque as the blunder may seem by which we thus introduce our poetic
tropes into the sequence of external events or existences, the blunder
is intellectual only; morally, zeal for our special rhetoric may not be
irrational. The lovely Phoebus is no fact for astronomy, nor does he
stand behind the material sun, in some higher heaven, physically
superintending its movements; but Phoebus is a fact in his own region, a
token of man's joyful piety in the presence of the forces that really
condition his welfare. In the region of symbols, in the world of poetry,
Phoebus has his inalienable rights. Forms of poetry are forms of human
life. Languages express national character and enshrine particular ways
of seeing and valuing events. To make substitutions and extensions in
expression is to give the soul, in her inmost substance, a somewhat new
constitution. A method of apperception is a spontaneous variation in
mind, perhaps the origin of a new moral species.</p>

<p>The value apperceptive methods have is of course largely representative,
in that they serve more or less aptly to dominate the order of events
and to guide action; but quite apart from this practical value,
expressions possess a character of their own, a sort of vegetative life,
as languages possess <a name="Page_181" id="Page_181" />euphony. Two reports of the same fact may be
equally trustworthy, equally useful as information, yet they may embody
two types of mental rhetoric, and this diversity in genius may be of
more intrinsic importance than the raw fact it works upon. The
non-representative side of human perception may thus be the most
momentous side of it, because it represents, or even constitutes, the
man. After all, the chief interest we have in things lies in what we can
make of them or what they can make of us. There is consequently nothing
fitted to colour human happiness more pervasively than art does, nor to
express more deeply the mind's internal habit. In educating the
imagination art crowns all moral endeavour, which from the beginning is
a species of art, and which becomes a fine art more completely as it
works in a freer medium.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The importance of &aelig;sthetic goods varies with temperaments.</div>

<p>How great a portion of human energies should be spent on art and its
appreciation is a question to be answered variously by various persons
and nations. There is no ideal <i>&agrave; priori</i>; an ideal can but express, if
it is genuine, the balance of impulses and potentialities in a given
soul. A mind at once sensuous and mobile will find its appropriate
perfection in studying and reconstructing objects of sense. Its
rationality will appear chiefly on the plane of perception, to render
the circle of visions which makes up its life as delightful as possible.
For such a man art <a name="Page_182" id="Page_182" />will be the most satisfying, the most significant
activity, and to load him with material riches or speculative truths or
profound social loyalties will be to impede and depress him. The
irrational is what does not justify itself in the end; and the born
artist, repelled by the soberer and bitterer passions of the world, may
justly call them irrational. They would not justify themselves in his
experience; they make grievous demands and yield nothing in the end
which is intelligible to him. His picture of them, if he be a dramatist,
will hardly fail to be satirical; fate, frailty, illusion will be his
constant themes. If his temperament could find political expression, he
would minimise the machinery of life and deprecate any calculated
prudence. He would trust the heart, enjoy nature, and not frown too
angrily on inclination. Such a Bohemia he would regard as an ideal world
in which humanity might flourish congenially.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The &aelig;sthetic temperament requires tutelage.</div>

<p>A puritan moralist, before condemning such an infantile paradise, should
remember that a commonwealth of butterflies actually exists. It is not
any inherent wrongness in such an ideal that makes it unacceptable, but
only the fact that human butterflies are not wholly mercurial and that
even imperfect geniuses are but an extreme type in a society whose
guiding ideal is based upon a broader humanity than the artist
represents. Men of science or business will accuse the poet of <a name="Page_183" id="Page_183" />folly,
on the very grounds on which he accuses them of the same. Each will seem
to the other to be obeying a barren obsession. The statesman or
philosopher who should aspire to adjust their quarrel could do so only
by force of intelligent sympathy with both sides, and in view of the
common conditions in which they find themselves. What ought to be done
is that which, when done, will most nearly justify itself to all
concerned. Practical problems of morals are judicial and political
problems. Justice can never be pronounced without hearing the parties
and weighing the interests at stake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">&AElig;sthetic values everywhere interfused.</div>

<p>A circumstance that complicates such a calculation is this: &aelig;esthetic
and other interests are not separable units, to be compared externally;
they are rather strands interwoven in the texture of everything.
&AElig;sthetic sensibility colours every thought, qualifies every allegiance,
and modifies every product of human labour. Consequently the love of
beauty has to justify itself not merely intrinsically, or as a
constituent part of life more or less to be insisted upon; it has to
justify itself also as an influence. A hostile influence is the most
odious of things. The enemy himself, the alien creature, lies in his own
camp, and in a speculative moment we may put ourselves in his place and
learn to think of him charitably; but his spirit in our own souls is
like a private tempter, a treasonable voice weakening our allegiance to
our own <a name="Page_184" id="Page_184" />duty. A zealot might allow his neighbours to be damned in
peace, did not a certain heretical odour emitted by them infect the
sanctuary and disturb his own dogmatic calm. In the same way practical
people might leave the artist alone in his oasis, and even grant him a
pittance on which to live, as they feed the animals in a zoological
garden, did he not intrude into their inmost conclave and vitiate the
abstract cogency of their designs. It is not so much art in its own
field that men of science look askance upon, as the love of glitter and
rhetoric and false finality trespassing upon scientific ground; while
men of affairs may well deprecate a rooted habit of sensuous absorption
and of sudden transit to imaginary worlds, a habit which must work havoc
in their own sphere. In other words, there is an element of poetry
inherent in thought, in conduct, in affection; and we must ask ourselves
how far this ingredient is an obstacle to their proper development.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They are primordial.</div>

<p>The fabled dove who complained, in flying, of the resistance of the air,
was as wise as the philosopher who should lament the presence and
influence of sense. Sense is the native element and substance of
experience; all its refinements are still parts of it existentially; and
whatever excellence belongs specifically to sense is a preliminary
excellence, a value antecedent to any which thought or action can
achieve. Science and morals have but representative authority; they are
principles of ideal synthesis and <a name="Page_185" id="Page_185" />safe transition; they are bridges
from moment to moment of sentience. Their function is indeed universal
and their value overwhelming, yet their office remains derivative or
secondary, and what they serve to put in order has previously its
intrinsic worth. An &aelig;sthetic bias is native to sense, being indeed
nothing but its form and potency; and the influence which &aelig;sthetic
habits exercise on thought and action should not be regarded as an
intrusion to be resented, but rather as an original interest to be built
upon and developed. Sensibility contains the distinctions which reason
afterward carries out and applies; it is sensibility that involves and
supports primitive diversities, such as those between good and bad, here
and there, fast and slow, light and darkness. There are complications
and harmonies inherent in these oppositions, harmonies which &aelig;sthetic
faculty proceeds to note; and from these we may then construct others,
not immediately presentable, which we distinguish by attributing them to
reason. Reason may well outflank and transform &aelig;sthetic judgments, but
can never undermine them. Its own materials are the perceptions which if
full and perfect are called beauties. Its function is to endow the parts
of sentience with a consciousness of the system in which they lie, so
that they may attain a mutual relevance and ideally support one another.
But what could relevance or support be worth if the things to be
buttressed were themselves worthless? It is not to organise pain,
ugli<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186" />ness, and boredom that reason can be called into the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To superpose them adventitiously is to destroy them.</div>

<p>When a practical or scientific man boasts that he has laid aside
&aelig;sthetic prejudices and is following truth and utility with a single
eye, he can mean, if he is judicious, only that he has not yielded to
&aelig;sthetic preference after his problem was fixed, nor in an arbitrary and
vexatious fashion. He has not consulted taste when it would have been in
bad taste to do so. If he meant that he had rendered himself altogether
insensible to &aelig;sthetic values, and that he had proceeded to organise
conduct or thought in complete indifference to the beautiful, he would
be simply proclaiming his inhumanity and incompetence. A right
observance of &aelig;sthetic demands does not obstruct utility nor logic; for
utility and logic are themselves beautiful, while a sensuous beauty that
ran counter to reason could never be, in the end, pleasing to an
exquisite sense. &AElig;sthetic vice is not favourable to &aelig;sthetic faculty: it
is an impediment to the greatest &aelig;sthetic satisfactions. And so when by
yielding to a blind passion for beauty we derange theory and practice,
we cut ourselves off from those beauties which alone could have
satisfied our passion. What we drag in so obstinately will bring but a
cheap and unstable pleasure, while a double beauty will thereby be lost
or obscured&mdash;first, the unlooked-for beauty which a genuine and stable
system of things could not but betray, and secondly the coveted <a name="Page_187" id="Page_187" />beauty
itself, which, being imported here into the wrong context, will be
rendered meretricious and offensive to good taste. If a jewel worn on
the wrong finger sends a shiver through the flesh, how disgusting must
not rhetoric be in diplomacy or unction in metaphysics!</p>

<div class="sidenote">They flow naturally from perfect function.</div>

<p>The poetic element inherent in thought, affection, and conduct is prior
to their prosaic development and altogether legitimate. Clear,
well-digested perception and rational choices follow upon those primary
creative impulses, and carry out their purpose systematically. At every
stage in this development new and appropriate materials are offered for
&aelig;sthetic contemplation. Straightness, for instance, symmetry, and rhythm
are at first sensuously defined; they are characters arrested by
&aelig;sthetic instinct; but they are the materials of mathematics. And long
after these initial forms have disowned their sensuous values, and
suffered a wholly dialectical expansion or analysis, mathematical
objects again fall under the &aelig;sthetic eye, and surprise the senses by
their emotional power. A mechanical system, such as astronomy in one
region has already unveiled, is an inexhaustible field for &aelig;sthetic
wonder. Similarly, in another sphere, sensuous affinity leads to
friendship and love, and makes us huddle up to our fellows and feel
their heart-beats; but when human society has thereupon established a
legal and moral edifice, this new spectacle yields new imaginative
trans<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188" />ports, tragic, lyric, and religious. &AElig;sthetic values everywhere
precede and accompany rational activity, and life is, in one aspect,
always a fine art; not by introducing inaptly &aelig;sthetic vetoes or
&aelig;sthetic flourishes, but by giving to everything a form which, implying
a structure, implies also an ideal and a possible perfection. This
perfection, being felt, is also a beauty, since any process, though it
may have become intellectual or practical, remains for all that a vital
and sentient operation, with its inherent sensuous values. Whatever is
to be representative in import must first be immediate in existence;
whatever is transitive in operation must be at the same time actual in
being. So that an &aelig;sthetic sanction sweetens all successful living;
animal efficiency cannot be without grace, nor moral achievement without
a sensible glory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Even inhibited functions, when they fall into a new rhythm,
yield new beauties.</div>

<p>These vital harmonies are natural; they are neither perfect nor
preordained. We often come upon beauties that need to be sacrificed, as
we come upon events and practical necessities without number that are
truly regrettable. There are a myriad conflicts in practice and in
thought, conflicts between rival possibilities, knocking inopportunely
and in vain at the door of existence. Owing to the initial
disorganisation of things, some demands continually prove to be
incompatible with others arising no less naturally. Reason in such cases
imposes real and irreparable sacrifices, but it brings a stable
consolation if its dis<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189" />cipline is accepted. Decay, for instance, is a
moral and &aelig;sthetic evil; but being a natural necessity it can become the
basis for pathetic and magnificent harmonies, when once imagination is
adjusted to it. The hatred of change and death is ineradicable while
life lasts, since it expresses that self-sustaining organisation in a
creature which we call its soul; yet this hatred of change and death is
not so deeply seated in the nature of things as are death and change
themselves, for the flux is deeper than the ideal. Discipline may attune
our higher and more adaptable part to the harsh conditions of being, and
the resulting sentiment, being the only one which can be maintained
successfully, will express the greatest satisfactions which can be
reached, though not the greatest that might be conceived or desired. To
be interested in the changing seasons is, in this middling zone, a
happier state of mind than to be hopelessly in love with spring. Wisdom
discovers these possible accommodations, as circumstances impose them;
and education ought to prepare men to accept them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He who loves beauty must chasten it.</div>

<p>It is for want of education and discipline that a man so often insists
petulantly on his random tastes, instead of cultivating those which
might find some satisfaction in the world and might produce in him some
pertinent culture. Untutored self-assertion may even lead him to deny
some fact that should have been patent, and <a name="Page_190" id="Page_190" />plunge him into needless
calamity. His Utopias cheat him in the end, if indeed the barbarous
taste he has indulged in clinging to them does not itself lapse before
the dream is half formed. So men have feverishly conceived a heaven only
to find it insipid, and a hell to find it ridiculous. Theodicies that
were to demonstrate an absolute cosmic harmony have turned the universe
into a tyrannous nightmare, from which we are glad to awake again in
this unintentional and somewhat tractable world. Thus the fancies of
effeminate poets in violating science are false to the highest art, and
the products of sheer confusion, instigated by the love of beauty, turn
out to be hideous. A rational severity in respect to art simply weeds
the garden; it expresses a mature &aelig;sthetic choice and opens the way to
supreme artistic achievements. To keep beauty in its place is to make
all things beautiful.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>THE CRITERION OF TASTE</p>


<div class="sidenote">Dogmatism is inevitable but may be enlightened.</div>

<p>Dogmatism in matters of taste has the same status as dogmatism in other
spheres. It is initially justified by sincerity, being a systematic
expression of a man's preferences; but it becomes absurd when its basis
in a particular disposition is ignored and it pretends to have an
absolute or metaphysical scope. Reason, with the order which in every
region it imposes on life, is grounded on an animal nature and has no
other function than to serve the same; and it fails to exercise its
office quite as much when it oversteps its bounds and forgets whom it is
serving as when it neglects some part of its legitimate province and
serves its master imperfectly, without considering all his interests.</p>

<p>Dialectic, logic, and morals lose their authority and become inept if
they trespass upon the realm of physics and try to disclose existences;
while physics is a mere idea in the realm of poetic meditation. So the
notorious diversities which human taste exhibits do not become
conflicts, and raise no moral problem, until their basis or their
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192" />function has been forgotten, and each has claimed a right to assert
itself exclusively. This claim is altogether absurd, and we might fail
to understand how so preposterous an attitude could be assumed by
anybody did we not remember that every young animal thinks himself
absolute, and that dogmatism in the thinker is only the speculative side
of greed and courage in the brute. The brute cannot surrender his
appetites nor abdicate his primary right to dominate his environment.
What experience and reason may teach him is merely how to make his
self-assertion well balanced and successful. In the same way taste is
bound to maintain its preferences but free to rationalise them. After a
man has compared his feelings with the no less legitimate feelings of
other creatures, he can reassert his own with more complete authority,
since now he is aware of their necessary ground in his nature, and of
their affinities with whatever other interests his nature enables him to
recognise in others and to co-ordinate with his own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Taste gains in authority as it is more and more widely
based.</div>

<p>A criterion of taste is, therefore, nothing but taste itself in its more
deliberate and circumspect form. Reflection refines particular
sentiments by bringing them into sympathy with all rational life. There
is consequently the greatest possible difference in authority between
taste and taste, and while delight in drums and eagle's feathers is
perfectly genuine and has no cause to blush for <a name="Page_193" id="Page_193" />itself, it cannot be
compared in scope or representative value with delight in a symphony or
an epic. The very instinct that is satisfied by beauty prefers one
beauty to another; and we have only to question and purge our &aelig;sthetic
feelings in order to obtain our criterion of taste. This criterion will
be natural, personal, autonomous; a circumstance that will give it
authority over our own judgment&mdash;which is all moral science is concerned
about&mdash;and will extend its authority over other minds also, in so far as
their constitution is similar to ours. In that measure what is a genuine
instance of reason in us, others will recognise for a genuine expression
of reason in themselves also.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Different &aelig;sthetic endowments may be compared in quantity or
force.</div>

<p>&AElig;sthetic feeling, in different people, may make up a different fraction
of life and vary greatly in volume. The more nearly insensible a man is
the more incompetent he becomes to proclaim the values which sensibility
might have. To beauty men are habitually insensible, even while they are
awake and rationally active. Tomes of &aelig;sthetic criticism hang on a few
moments of real delight and intuition. It is in rare and scattered
instants that beauty smiles even on her adorers, who are reduced for
habitual comfort to remembering her past favours. An &aelig;sthetic glow may
pervade experience, but that circumstance is seldom remarked; it figures
only as an influence working subterraneously on thoughts <a name="Page_194" id="Page_194" />and judgments
which in themselves take a cognitive or practical direction. Only when
the &aelig;sthetic ingredient becomes predominant do we exclaim, How
beautiful! Ordinarily the pleasures which formal perception gives remain
an undistinguished part of our comfort or curiosity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Authority of vital over verbal judgments</div>

<p>Taste is formed in those moments when &aelig;sthetic emotion is massive and
distinct; preferences then grown conscious, judgments then put into
words, will reverberate through calmer hours; they will constitute
prejudices, habits of apperception, secret standards for all other
beauties. A period of life in which such intuitions have been frequent
may amass tastes and ideals sufficient for the rest of our days. Youth
in these matters governs maturity, and while men may develop their early
impressions more systematically and find confirmations of them in
various quarters, they will seldom look at the world afresh or use new
categories in deciphering it. Half our standards come from our first
masters, and the other half from our first loves. Never being so deeply
stirred again, we remain persuaded that no objects save those we then
discovered can have a true sublimity. These high-water marks of &aelig;sthetic
life may easily be reached under tutelage. It may be some eloquent
appreciations read in a book, or some preference expressed by a gifted
friend, that may have revealed unsuspected beauties in art or nature;
and then, since our <a name="Page_195" id="Page_195" />own perception was vicarious and obviously inferior
in volume to that which our mentor possessed, we shall take his
judgments for our criterion, since they were the source and exemplar of
all our own. Thus the volume and intensity of some appreciations,
especially when nothing of the kind has preceded, makes them
authoritative over our subsequent judgments. On those warm moments hang
all our cold systematic opinions; and while the latter fill our days and
shape our careers it is only the former that are crucial and alive.</p>

<p>A race which loves beauty holds the same place in history that a season
of love or enthusiasm holds in an individual life. Such a race has a
pre-eminent right to pronounce upon beauty and to bequeath its judgments
to duller peoples. We may accordingly listen with reverence to a Greek
judgment on that subject, expecting that what might seem to us wrong
about it is the expression of knowledge and passion beyond our range; it
will suffice that we learn to live in the world of beauty, instead of
merely studying its relics, for us to understand, for instance, that
imitation is a fundamental principle in art, and that any rational
judgment on the beautiful must be a moral and political judgment,
enveloping chance &aelig;sthetic feelings and determining their value. What
most German philosophers, on the contrary, have written about art and
beauty has a minimal importance: it treats artificial problems <a name="Page_196" id="Page_196" />in a
grammatical spirit, seldom giving any proof of experience or
imagination. What painters say about painting and poets about poetry is
better than lay opinion; it may reveal, of course, some petty jealousy
or some partial incapacity, because a special gift often carries with it
complementary defects in apprehension; yet what is positive in such
judgments is founded on knowledge and avoids the romancing into which
litterateurs and sentimentalists will gladly wander. The specific values
of art are technical values, more permanent and definite than the
adventitious analogies on which a stray observer usually bases his
views. Only a technical education can raise judgments on musical
compositions above impertinent auto-biography. The Japanese know the
beauty of flowers, and tailors and dressmakers have the best sense for
the fashions. We ask them for suggestions, and if we do not always take
their advice, it is not because the fine effects they love are not
genuine, but because they may not be effects which we care to produce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tastes differ also in purity or consistency.</div>

<p>This touches a second consideration, besides the volume and vivacity of
feeling, which enters into good taste. What is voluminous may be
inwardly confused or outwardly confusing. Excitement, though on the
whole and for the moment agreeable, may verge on pain and may be, when
it subsides a little, a cause of bitterness. A thing's attractions may
be partly at war with its ideal <a name="Page_197" id="Page_197" />function. In such a case what, in our
haste, we call a beauty becomes hateful on a second view, and according
to the key of our dissatisfaction we pronounce that effect meretricious,
harsh, or affected. These discords appear when elaborate things are
attempted without enough art and refinement; they are essentially in bad
taste. Rudimentary effects, on the contrary, are pure, and though we may
think them trivial when we are expecting something richer, their defect
is never intrinsic; they do not plunge us, as impure excitements do,
into a corrupt artificial conflict. So wild-flowers, plain chant, or a
scarlet uniform are beautiful enough; their simplicity is a positive
merit, while their crudity is only relative. There is a touch of
sophistication and disease in not being able to fall back on such things
and enjoy them thoroughly, as if a man could no longer relish a glass of
water. Your true epicure will study not to lose so genuine a pleasure.
Better forego some artificial stimulus, though that, too, has its charm,
than become insensible to natural joys. Indeed, ability to revert to
elementary beauties is a test that judgment remains sound.</p>

<p>Vulgarity is quite another matter. An old woman in a blonde wig, a dirty
hand covered with jewels, ostentation without dignity, rhetoric without
cogency, all offend by an inner contradiction. To like such things we
should have to surrender our better intuitions and suffer a kind of
dishon<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198" />our. Yet the elements offensively combined may be excellent in
isolation, so that an untrained or torpid mind will be at a loss to
understand the critic's displeasure. Oftentimes barbaric art almost
succeeds, by dint of splendour, in banishing the sense of confusion and
absurdity; for everything, even reason, must bow to force. Yet the
impression remains chaotic, and we must be either partly inattentive or
partly distressed. Nothing could show better than this alternative how
mechanical barbaric art is. Driven by blind impulse or tradition, the
artist has worked in the dark. He has dismissed his work without having
quite understood it or really justified it to his own mind. It is rather
his excretion than his product. Astonished, very likely, at his own
fertility, he has thought himself divinely inspired, little knowing that
clear reason is the highest and truest of inspirations. Other men,
observing his obscure work, have then honoured him for profundity; and
so mere bulk or stress or complexity have produced a mystical wonder by
which generation after generation may be enthralled. Barbaric art is
half necromantic; its ascendancy rests in a certain measure on
bewilderment and fraud.</p>

<p>To purge away these impurities nothing is needed but quickened
intelligence, a keener spiritual flame. Where perception is adequate,
expression is so too, and if a man will only grow sensitive to the
various solicitations which any<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199" />thing monstrous combines, he will
thereby perceive its monstrosity. Let him but enact his sensations, let
him pause to make explicit the confused hints that threaten to stupefy
him; he will find that he can follow out each of them only by rejecting
and forgetting the others. To free his imagination in any direction he
must disengage it from the contrary intent, and so he must either purify
his object or leave it a mass of confused promptings. Promptings
essentially demand to be carried out, and when once an idea has become
articulate it is not enriched but destroyed if it is still identified
with its contrary. Any complete expression of a barbarous theme will,
therefore, disengage its incompatible elements and turn it into a number
of rational beauties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They differ, finally, in pertinence, and in width of appeal.</div>

<p>When good taste has in this way purified and digested some turgid
medley, it still has a progress to make. Ideas, like men, live in
society. Not only has each a will of its own and an inherent ideal, but
each finds itself conditioned for its expression by a host of other
beings, on whose co-operation it depends. Good taste, besides being
inwardly clear, has to be outwardly fit. A monstrous ideal devours and
dissolves itself, but even a rational one does not find an immortal
embodiment simply for being inwardly possible and free from
contradiction. It needs a material basis, a soil and situation
propitious to its growth. This basis, as it varies, makes the ideal vary
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200" />which is simply its expression; and therefore no ideal can be
ultimately fixed in ignorance of the conditions that may modify it. It
subsists, to be sure, as an eternal possibility, independently of all
further earthly revolutions. Once expressed, it has revealed the
inalienable values that attach to a certain form of being, whenever that
form is actualised. But its expression may have been only momentary, and
that eternal ideal may have no further relevance to the living world. A
criterion of taste, however, looks to a social career; it hopes to
educate and to judge. In order to be an applicable and a just law, it
must represent the interests over which it would preside.</p>

<p>There are many undiscovered ideals. There are many beauties which
nothing in this world can embody or suggest. There are also many once
suggested or even embodied, which find later their basis gone and
evaporate into their native heaven. The saddest tragedy in the world is
the destruction of what has within it no inward ground of dissolution,
death in youth, and the crushing out of perfection. Imagination has its
bereavements of this kind. A complete mastery of existence achieved at
one moment gives no warrant that it will be sustained or achieved again
at the next. The achievement may have been perfect; nature will not on
that account stop to admire it. She will move on, and the meaning which
was read so triumphantly in her momentary attitude will not fit her new
posture. <a name="Page_201" id="Page_201" />Like Polonius's cloud, she will always suggest some new ideal,
because she has none of her own.</p>

<p>In lieu of an ideal, however, nature has a constitution, and this, which
is a necessary ground for ideals, is what it concerns the ideal to
reckon with. A poet, spokesman of his full soul at a given juncture,
cannot consider eventualities or think of anything but the message he is
sent to deliver, whether the world can then hear it or not. God, he may
feel sure, understands him, and in the eternal the beauty he sees and
loves immortally justifies his enthusiasm. Nevertheless, critics must
view his momentary ebullition from another side. They do not come to
justify the poet in his own eyes; he amply relieves them, of such a
function. They come only to inquire how significant the poet's
expressions are for humanity at large or for whatever public he
addresses. They come to register the social or representative value of
the poet's soul. His inspiration may have been an odd cerebral rumbling,
a perfectly irrecoverable and wasted intuition; the exquisite quality it
doubtless had to his own sense is now not to the purpose. A work of art
is a public possession; it is addressed to the world. By taking on a
material embodiment, a spirit solicits attention and claims some kinship
with the prevalent gods. Has it, critics should ask, the affinities
needed for such intercourse? Is it humane, is it rational, is it
representative? To its inherent incommunicable charms it must add a
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202" />kind of courtesy. If it wants other approval than its own, it cannot
afford to regard no other aspiration.</p>

<p>This scope, this representative faculty or wide appeal, is necessary to
good taste. All authority is representative; force and inner consistency
are gifts on which I may well congratulate another, but they give him no
right to speak for me. Either &aelig;sthetic experience would have remained a
chaos&mdash;which it is not altogether&mdash;or it must have tended to conciliate
certain general human demands and ultimately all those interests which
its operation in any way affects. The more conspicuous and permanent a
work of art is, the more is such an adjustment needed. A poet or
philosopher may be erratic and assure us that he is inspired; if we
cannot well gainsay it, we are at least not obliged to read his works.
An architect or a sculptor, however, or a public performer of any sort,
that thrusts before us a spectacle justified only in his inner
consciousness, makes himself a nuisance. A social standard of taste must
assert itself here, or else no efficacious and cumulative art can exist
at all. Good taste in such matters cannot abstract from tradition,
utility, and the temper of the world. It must make itself an interpreter
of humanity and think esoteric dreams less beautiful than what the
public eye might conceivably admire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Art may grow classic by idealising the familiar.</div>

<p>There are various affinities by which art may acquire a representative
or classic quality. It <a name="Page_203" id="Page_203" />may do so by giving form to objects which
everybody knows, by rendering experiences that are universal and
primary. The human figure, elementary passions, common types and crises
of fate&mdash;these are facts which pass too constantly through apperception
not to have a normal &aelig;thetic value. The artist who can catch that effect
in its fulness and simplicity accordingly does immortal work. This sort
of art immediately becomes popular; it passes into language and
convention so that its &aelig;sthetic charm is apparently worn down. The old
images after a while hardly stimulate unless they be presented in some
paradoxical way; but in that case attention will be diverted to the
accidental extravagance, and the chief classic effect will be missed. It
is the honourable fate or euthanasia of artistic successes that they
pass from the field of professional art altogether and become a portion
of human faculty. Every man learns to be to that extent an artist;
approved figures and maxims pass current like the words and idioms of a
mother-tongue, themselves once brilliant inventions. The lustre of such
successes is not really dimmed, however, when it becomes a part of man's
daily light; a retrogression from that habitual style or habitual
insight would at once prove, by the shock it caused, how precious those
ingrained apperceptions continued to be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">or by reporting the ultimate.</div>

<p>Universality may also be achieved, in a more heroic fashion, by art that
expresses ultimate <a name="Page_204" id="Page_204" />truths, cosmic laws, great human ideals. Virgil and
Dante are classic poets in this sense, and a similar quality belongs to
Greek sculpture and architecture. They may not cause enthusiasm in
everybody; but in the end experience and reflection renew their charm;
and their greatness, like that of high mountains, grows more obvious
with distance. Such eminence is the reward of having accepted discipline
and made the mind a clear anagram of much experience. There is a great
difference between the depth of expression so gained and richness or
realism in details. A supreme work presupposes minute study, sympathy
with varied passions, many experiments in expression; but these
preliminary things are submerged in it and are not displayed side by
side with it, like the foot-notes to a learned work, so that the
ignorant may know they have existed.</p>

<p>Some persons, themselves inattentive, imagine, for instance, that Greek
sculpture is abstract, that it has left out all the detail and character
which they cannot find on the surface, as they might in a modern work.
In truth it contains those features, as it were, in solution and in the
resultant which, when reduced to harmony, they would produce. It
embodies a finished humanity which only varied exercises could have
attained, for as the body is the existent ground for all possible
actions, in which as actions they exist only po<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205" />tentially, so a perfect
body, such as a sculptor might conceive, which ought to be ready for all
excellent activities, cannot present them all in act but only the
readiness for them. The features that might express them severally must
be absorbed and mastered, hidden like a sword in its scabbard, and
reduced to a general dignity or grace. Though such immersed eloquence be
at first overlooked and seldom explicitly acknowledged, homage is
nevertheless rendered to it in the most unmistakable ways. When lazy
artists, backed by no great technical or moral discipline, think they,
too, can produce masterpieces by summary treatment, their failure shows
how pregnant and supreme a thing simplicity is. Every man, in proportion
to his experience and moral distinction, returns to the simple but
inexhaustible work of finished minds, and finds more and more of his own
soul responsive to it.</p>

<p>Human nature, for all its margin of variability, has a substantial core
which is invariable, as the human body has a structure which it cannot
lose without perishing altogether; for as creatures grow more complex a
greater number of their organs become vital and indispensable. Advanced
forms will rather die than surrender a tittle of their character; a fact
which is the physical basis for loyalty and martyrdom. Any deep
interpretation of oneself, or indeed of anything, has for that reason a
largely representative truth. Other men, if they look closely, will make
the same dis<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206" />covery for themselves. Hence distinction and profundity, in
spite of their rarity, are wont to be largely recognised. The best men
in all ages keep classic traditions alive. These men have on their side
the weight of superior intelligence, and, though they are few, they
might even claim the weight of numbers, since the few of all ages, added
together, may be more than the many who in any one age follow a
temporary fashion. Classic work is nevertheless always national, or at
least characteristic of its period, as the classic poetry of each people
is that in which its language appears most pure and free. To translate
it is impossible; but it is easy to find that the human nature so
inimitably expressed in each masterpiece is the same that, under
different circumstance, dictates a different performance. The deviations
between races and men are not yet so great as is the ignorance of self,
the blindness to the native ideal, which prevails in most of them. Hence
a great man of a remote epoch is more intelligible than a common man of
our own time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good taste demands that art should be rational, <i>i.e.</i>,
harmonious with all other interests.</div>

<p>Both elementary and ultimate judgments, then, contribute to a standard
of taste; yet human life lies between these limits, and an art which is
to be truly adjusted to life should speak also for the intermediate
experience. Good taste is indeed nothing but a name for those
appreciations which the swelling incidents of life recall <a name="Page_207" id="Page_207" />and
reinforce. Good taste is that taste which is a good possession, a friend
to the whole man. It must not alienate him from anything except to ally
him to something greater and more fertile in satisfactions. It will not
suffer him to dote on things, however seductive, which rob him of some
nobler companionship. To have a foretaste of such a loss, and to reject
instinctively whatever will cause it, is the very essence of refinement.
Good taste comes, therefore, from experience, in the best sense of that
word; it comes from having united in one's memory and character the
fruit of many diverse undertakings. Mere taste is apt to be bad taste,
since it regards nothing but a chance feeling. Every man who pursues an
art may be presumed to have some sensibility; the question is whether he
has breeding, too, and whether what he stops at is not, in the end,
vulgar and offensive. Chance feeling needs to fortify itself with
reasons and to find its level in the great world. When it has added
fitness to its sincerity, beneficence to its passion, it will have
acquired a right to live. Violence and self-justification will not pass
muster in a moral society, for vipers possess both, and must
nevertheless be stamped out. Citizenship is conferred only on creatures
with human and co-operative instincts. A civilised imagination has to
understand and to serve the world.</p>

<p>The great obstacle which art finds in attempting to be rational is its
functional isolation. <a name="Page_208" id="Page_208" />Sense and each of the passions suffers from a
similar independence. The disarray of human instincts lets every
spontaneous motion run too far; life oscillates between constraint and
unreason. Morality too often puts up with being a constraint and even
imagines such a disgrace to be its essence. Art, on the contrary, as
often hugs unreason for fear of losing its inspiration, and forgets that
it is itself a rational principle of creation and order. Morality is
thus reduced to a necessary evil and art to a vain good, all for want of
harmony among human impulses. If the passions arose in season, if
perception fed only on those things which action should be adjusted to,
turning them, while action proceeded, into the substance of ideas&mdash;then
all conduct would be voluntary and enlightened, all speculation would be
practical, all perceptions beautiful, and all operations arts. The Life
of Reason would then be universal.</p>

<p>To approach this ideal, so far as art is concerned, would involve
diffusing its processes and no longer confining them to a set of dead
and unproductive objects called works of art.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A mere &quot;work of art&quot; a baseless artifice.</div>

<p>Why art, the most vital and generative of activities, should produce a
set of abstract images, monuments to lost intuitions, is a curious
mystery. Nature gives her products life, and they are at least equal to
their sources in dignity. Why should mind, the actualisation of nature's
powers, <a name="Page_209" id="Page_209" />produce something so inferior to itself, reverting in its
expression to material being, so that its witnesses seem so many fossils
with which it strews its path? What we call museums&mdash;mausoleums, rather,
in which a dead art heaps up its remains&mdash;are those the places where the
Muses intended to dwell? We do not keep in show-cases the coins current
in the world. A living art does not produce curiosities to be collected
but spiritual necessaries to be diffused.</p>

<p>Artificial art, made to be exhibited, is something gratuitous and
sophisticated, and the greater part of men's concern about it is
affectation. There is a genuine pleasure in planning a work, in
modelling and painting it; there is a pleasure in showing it to a
sympathetic friend, who associates himself in this way with the artist's
technical experiment and with his interpretation of some human episode;
and there might be a satisfaction in seeing the work set up in some
appropriate space for which it was designed, where its decorative
quality might enrich the scene, and the curious passer-by might stop to
decipher it. The pleasures proper to an ingenuous artist are spontaneous
and human; but his works, once delivered to his patrons, are household
furniture for the state. Set up to-day, they are outworn and replaced
to-morrow, like trees in the parks or officers in the government. A
community where art was native and flourishing would have an
uninterrupted supply of such ornaments, furnished by <a name="Page_210" id="Page_210" />its citizens in
the same modest and cheerful spirit in which they furnish other
commodities. Every craft has its dignity, and the decorative and
monumental crafts certainly have their own; but such art is neither
singular nor pre-eminent, and a statesman or reformer who should raise
somewhat the level of thought or practice in the state would do an
infinitely greater service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Human uses give to works of art their highest expression and
charm.</div>

<p>The joys of creating are not confined, moreover, to those who create
things without practical uses. The merely &aelig;sthetic, like rhyme and
fireworks, is not the only subject that can engage a playful fancy or be
planned with a premonition of beautiful effects. Architecture may be
useful, sculpture commemorative, poetry reflective, even, music, by its
expression, religious or martial. In a word, practical exigencies, in
calling forth the arts, give them moral functions which it is a pleasure
to see them fulfil. Works may not be &aelig;sthetic in their purpose, and yet
that fact may be a ground for their being doubly delightful in execution
and doubly beautiful in effect. A richer plexus of emotions is concerned
in producing or contemplating something humanly necessary than something
idly conceived. What is very rightly called a <i>sense</i> for fitness is a
vital experience, involving &aelig;sthetic satisfactions and &aelig;sthetic shocks.
The more numerous the rational harmonies are which are present to the
mind, the more sensible movements will be going <a name="Page_211" id="Page_211" />on there to give
immediate delight; for the perception or expectation of an ulterior good
is a present good also. Accordingly nothing can so well call forth or
sustain attention as what has a complex structure relating it to many
complex interests. A work woven out of precious threads has a deep
pertinence and glory; the artist who creates it does not need to
surrender his practical and moral sense in order to indulge his
imagination.</p>

<p>The truth is that mere sensation or mere emotion is an indignity to a
mature human being. When we eat, we demand a pleasant vista, flowers, or
conversation, and failing these we take refuge in a newspaper. The
monks, knowing that men should not feed silently like stalled oxen,
appointed some one to read aloud in the refectory; and the Fathers,
obeying the same civilised instinct, had contrived in their theology
intelligible points of attachment for religious emotion. A refined mind
finds as little happiness in love without friendship as in sensuality
without love; it may succumb to both, but it accepts neither. What is
true of mere sensibility is no less true of mere fancy. The Arabian
Nights&mdash;futile enough in any case&mdash;would be absolutely intolerable if
they contained no Oriental manners, no human passions, and no convinced
epicureanism behind their miracles and their tattle. Any absolute work
of art which serves no further purpose than to stimulate an emotion has
about it a cer<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212" />tain luxurious and visionary taint. We leave it with a
blank mind, and a pang bubbles up from the very fountain of pleasures.
Art, so long as it needs to be a dream, will never cease to prove a
disappointment. Its facile cruelty, its narcotic abstraction, can never
sweeten the evils we return to at home; it can liberate half the mind
only by leaving the other half in abeyance. In the mere artist, too,
there is always something that falls short of the gentleman and that
defeats the man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sad values of appearance.</div>

<p>Surely it is not the artistic impulse in itself that involves such lack
of equilibrium. To impress a meaning and a rational form on matter is
one of the most masterful of actions. The trouble lies in the barren and
superficial character of this imposed form: fine art is a play of
appearance. Appearance, for a critical philosophy, is distinguished from
reality by its separation from the context of things, by its immediacy
and insignificance. A play of appearance is accordingly some little
closed circle in experience, some dream in which we lose ourselves by
ignoring most of our interests, and from which we awake into a world in
which that lost episode plays no further part and leaves no heirs. Art
as mankind has hitherto practised it falls largely under this head and
too much resembles an opiate or a stimulant. Life and history are not
thereby rendered better in their principle, but a mere ideal is
extracted out of them and presented for our delectation in <a name="Page_213" id="Page_213" />some cheap
material, like words or marble. The only precious materials are flesh
and blood, for these alone can defend and propagate the ideal which has
once informed them.</p>

<p>Artistic creation shows at this point a great inferiority to natural
reproduction, since its product is dead. Fine art shapes inert matter
and peoples the mind with impotent ghosts. What influence it has&mdash;for
every event has consequences&mdash;is not pertinent to its inspiration. The
art of the past is powerless even to create similar art in the present,
unless similar conditions recur independently. The moments snatched for
art have been generally interludes in life and its products parasites in
nature, the body of them being materially functionless and the soul
merely represented. To exalt fine art into a truly ideal activity we
should have to knit it more closely with other rational functions, so
that to beautify things might render them more useful and to represent
them most imaginatively might be to see them in their truth. Something
of the sort has been actually attained by the noblest arts in their
noblest phases. A Sophocles or a Leonardo dominates his dreamful vehicle
and works upon the real world by its means. These small centres, where
interfunctional harmony is attained, ought to expand and cover the whole
field. Art, like religion, needs to be absorbed in the Life of Reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They need to be made prophetic of practical goods.</div>

<p>What might help to bring about this consummation would be, on the one
side, more knowl<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214" />edge; on the other, better taste. When a mind is filled
with important and true ideas and sees the actual relations of things,
it cannot relish pictures of the world which wantonly misrepresent it.
Myth and metaphor remain beautiful so long as they are the most adequate
or graphic means available for expressing the facts, but so soon as they
cease to be needful and sincere they become false finery. The same thing
happens in the plastic arts. Unless they spring from love of their
subject, and employ imagination only to penetrate into that subject and
interpret it with a more inward sympathy and truth, they become
conventional and overgrown with mere ornament. They then seem ridiculous
to any man who can truly conceive what they represent. So in putting
antique heroes on the stage we nowadays no longer tolerate a modern
costume, because the externals of ancient life are too well known to us;
but in the seventeenth century people demanded in such personages
intelligence and nobleness, since these were virtues which the ancients
were clothed with in their thought. A knowledge that should be at once
full and appreciative would evidently demand fidelity in both matters.
Knowledge, where it exists, undermines satisfaction in what does
violence to truth, and it renders such representations grotesque. If
knowledge were general and adequate the fine arts would accordingly be
brought round to expressing reality.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215" />which in turn would be suffused with beauty.</div>

<p>At the same time, if the rendering of reality is to remain artistic, it
must still study to satisfy the senses; but as this study would now
accompany every activity, taste would grow vastly more subtle and
exacting. Whatever any man said or did or made, he would be alive to its
&aelig;sthetic quality, and beauty would be a pervasive ingredient in
happiness. No work would be called, in a special sense, a work of art,
for all works would be such intrinsically; and even instinctive mimicry
and reproduction would themselves operate, not when mischief or idleness
prompted, but when some human occasion and some general utility made the
exercise of such skill entirely delightful. Thus there would need to be
no division of mankind into mechanical blind workers and half-demented
poets, and no separation of useful from fine art, such as people make
who have understood neither the nature nor the ultimate reward of human
action. All arts would be practised together and merged in the art of
life, the only one wholly useful or fine among them.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>ART AND HAPPINESS</p>


<div class="sidenote">&AElig;sthetic harmonies are parodies of real ones.</div>

<p>The greatest enemy harmony can have is a premature settlement in which
some essential force is wholly disregarded. This excluded element will
rankle in the flesh; it will bring about no end of disorders until it is
finally recognised and admitted into a truly comprehensive regimen. The
more numerous the interests which a premature settlement combines the
greater inertia will it oppose to reform, and the more self-righteously
will it condemn the innocent pariah that it leaves outside.</p>

<p>Art has had to suffer much Pharisaical opposition of this sort.
Sometimes political systems, sometimes religious zeal, have excluded it
from their programme, thereby making their programme unjust and
inadequate. Yet of all premature settlements the most premature is that
which the fine arts are wont to establish. A harmony in appearance only,
one that touches the springs of nothing and has no power to propagate
itself, is so partial and momentary a good that we may justly call it an
illusion. To gloat on rhythms and declama<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217" />tions, to live lost in
imaginary passions and histrionic woes, is an unmanly life, cut off from
practical dominion and from rational happiness. A lovely dream is an
excellent thing in itself, but it leaves the world no less a chaos and
makes it by contrast seem even darker than it did. By dwelling in its
mock heaven art may inflict on men the same kind of injury that any
irresponsible passion or luxurious vice might inflict. For this reason
it sometimes passes for a misfortune in a family if a son insists on
being a poet or an actor. Such gifts suggest too much incompetence and
such honours too much disrepute. A man does not avoid real evils by
having visionary pleasures, but besides exposing himself to the real
evils quite unprotected, he probably adds fancied evils to them in
generous measure. He becomes supersensitive, envious, hysterical; the
world, which was perhaps carried away at first by his ecstasies, at the
next moment merely applauds his performance, then criticises it
superciliously, and very likely ends by forgetting it altogether.</p>

<p>Thus the fine arts are seldom an original factor in human progress. If
they express moral and political greatness, and serve to enhance it,
they acquire a certain dignity; but so soon as this expressive function
is abandoned they grow meretricious. The artist becomes an abstracted
trifler, and the public is divided into two camps: the dilettanti, who
dote on the artist's affectations, and the rabble, who pay him to grow
coarse. Both influences <a name="Page_218" id="Page_218" />degrade him and he helps to foster both. An
atmosphere of dependence and charlatanry gathers about the artistic
attitude and spreads with its influence. Religion, philosophy, and
manners may in turn be infected with this spirit, being reduced to a
voluntary hallucination or petty flattery. Romanticism, ritualism,
&aelig;stheticism, symbolism are names this disease has borne at different
times as it appeared in different circles or touched a different object.
Needless to say that the arts themselves are the first to suffer. That
beauty which should have been an inevitable smile on the face of
society, an overflow of genuine happiness and power, has to be imported,
stimulated artificially, and applied from without; so that art becomes a
sickly ornament for an ugly existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">yet prototypes of true perfections.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, &aelig;sthetic harmony, so incomplete in its basis as to be
fleeting and deceptive, is most complete in its form. This so partial
synthesis is a synthesis indeed, and just because settlements made in
fancy are altogether premature, and ignore almost everything in the
world, in type they can be the most perfect settlements. The artist,
being a born lover of the good, a natural breeder of perfections, clings
to his insight. If the world calls his accomplishments vain, he can,
with better reason, call vain the world's cumbrous instrumentalities, by
which nothing clearly good is attained. Appearances, he may justly urge,
are alone actual. All forces, substances, realities, and principles are
inferred and <a name="Page_219" id="Page_219" />potential only and in the moral scale mere instruments to
bring perfect appearances about. To have grasped such an appearance, to
have embodied a form in matter, is to have justified for the first time
whatever may underlie appearance and to have put reality to some use. It
is to have begun to live. As the standard of perfection is internal and
is measured by the satisfaction felt in realising it, every artist has
tasted, in his activity, what activity essentially is. He has moulded
existence into the likeness of thought and lost himself in that ideal
achievement which, so to speak, beckons all things into being. Even if a
thousand misfortunes await him and a final disappointment, he has been
happy once. He may be inclined to rest his case there and challenge
practical people to justify in the same way the faith that is in them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pros and cons of detached indulgences.</div>

<p>That a moment of the most perfect happiness should prove a source of
unhappiness is no paradox to any one who has observed the world. A hope,
a passion, a crime, is a flash of vitality. It is inwardly congruous
with the will that breeds it, yet the happiness it pictures is so
partial that even while it is felt it may be overshadowed by sinister
forebodings. A certain unrest and insecurity may consciously harass it.
With time, or by a slight widening in the field of interest, this
submerged unhappiness may rise to the surface. If, as is probable, it is
caused or increased by the indulgence which preceded, <a name="Page_220" id="Page_220" />then the only
moment in which a good was tasted, the only vista that had opened
congenially before the mind, will prove a new and permanent curse. In
this way love often misleads individuals, ambition cities, and religion
whole races of men. That art, also, should often be an indulgence, a
blind that hides reality from ill-balanced minds and ultimately
increases their confusion, is by no means incompatible with art's ideal
essence. On the contrary, such a result is inevitable when ideality is
carried at all far upon a narrow basis. The more genuine and excellent
the vision the greater havoc it makes if, being inadequate, it
establishes itself authoritatively in the soul. Art, in the better
sense, is a condition of happiness for a practical and labouring
creature, since without art he remains a slave; but it is one more
source of unhappiness for him so long as it is not squared with his
necessary labours and merely interrupts them. It then alienates him from
his world without being able to carry him effectually into a better one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The happy imagination is one initially in line with things.</div>

<p>The artist is in many ways like a child. He seems happy, because his
life is spontaneous, yet he is not competent to secure his own good. To
be truly happy he must be well bred, reared from the cradle, as it were,
under propitious influences, so that he may have learned to love what
conduces to his development. In that rare case his art will expand as
his understanding ripens; he will not need to repent and begin again on
a lower key. <a name="Page_221" id="Page_221" />The ideal artist, like the ideal philosopher, has all time
and all existence for his virtual theme. Fed by the world he can help to
mould it, and his insight is a kind of wisdom, preparing him as science
might for using the world well and making it more fruitful. He can then
be happy, not merely in the sense of having now and then an ecstatic
moment, but happy in having light and resource enough within him to cope
steadily with real things and to leave upon them the vestige of his
mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and brought always closer to them by experience.</div>

<p>One effect of growing experience is to render what is unreal
uninteresting. Momentous alternatives in life are so numerous and the
possibilities they open up so varied that imagination finds enough
employment of a historic and practical sort in trying to seize them. A
child plans Towers of Babel; a mature architect, in planning, would lose
all interest if he were bidden to disregard gravity and economy. The
conditions of existence, after they are known and accepted, become
conditions for the only pertinent beauty. In each place, for each
situation, the plastic mind finds an appropriate ideal. It need not go
afield to import something exotic. It need make no sacrifices to whim
and to personal memories. It rather breeds out of the given problem a
new and singular solution, thereby exercising greater invention than
would be requisite for framing an arbitrary ideal and imposing it at all
costs on every occasion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222" />Reason is the principle of both art and happiness.</div>

<p>In other words, a happy result can be secured in art, as in life, only
by intelligence. Intelligence consists in having read the heart and
deciphered the promptings latent there, and then in reading the world
and deciphering its law and constitution, to see how and where the
heart's ideal may be embodied. Our troubles come from the colossal
blunders made by our ancestors (who had worse ancestors of their own) in
both these interpretations, blunders which have come down to us in our
blood and in our institutions. The vices thus transmitted cloud our
intelligence. We fail in practical affairs when we ignore the conditions
of action and we fail in works of imagination when we concoct what is
fantastic and without roots in the world.</p>

<p>The value of art lies in making people happy, first in practising the
art and then in possessing its product. This observation might seem
needless, and ought to be so; but if we compare it with what is commonly
said on these subjects, we must confess that it may often be denied and
more often, perhaps, may not be understood. Happiness is something men
ought to pursue, although they seldom do so; they are drawn away from it
at first by foolish impulses and afterwards by perverse laws. To secure
happiness conduct would have to remain spontaneous while it learned not
to be criminal; but the fanatical attachment of men, now to a fierce
liberty, now to a false regimen, keeps them barbarous and wretched. A
rational pur<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223" />suit of happiness&mdash;which is one thing with progress or with
the Life of Reason&mdash;would embody that natural piety which leaves to the
episodes of life their inherent values, mourning death, celebrating
love, sanctifying civic traditions, enjoying and correcting nature's
ways. To discriminate happiness is therefore the very soul of art, which
expresses experience without distorting it, as those political or
metaphysical tyrannies distort it which sanctify unhappiness. A free
mind, like a creative imagination, rejoices at the harmonies it can find
or make between man and nature; and, where it finds none, it solves the
conflict so far as it may and then notes and endures it with a shudder.</p>

<p>A morality organised about the human heart in an ingenuous and sincere
fashion would involve every fine art and would render the world
pervasively beautiful&mdash;beautiful in its artificial products and
beautiful in its underlying natural terrors. The closer we keep to
elementary human needs and to the natural agencies that may satisfy
them, the closer we are to beauty. Industry, sport, and science, with
the perennial intercourse and passions of men, swarm with incentives to
expression, because they are everywhere creating new moulds of being and
compelling the eye to observe those forms and to recast them ideally.
Art is simply an adequate industry; it arises when industry is carried
out to the satisfaction of all human demands, even of those incidental
sen<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224" />suous demands which we call &aelig;sthetic and which a brutal industry, in
its haste, may despise or ignore.</p>

<p>Arts responsive in this way to all human nature would be beautiful
according to reason and might remain beautiful long. Poetic beauty
touches the world whenever it attains some unfeigned harmony either with
sense or with reason; and the more unfeignedly human happiness was made
the test of all institutions and pursuits, the more beautiful they would
be, having more numerous points of fusion with the mind, and fusing with
it more profoundly. To distinguish and to create beauty would then be no
art relegated to a few abstracted spirits, playing with casual fancies;
it would be a habit inseparable from practical efficiency. All
operations, all affairs, would then be viewed in the light of ultimate
interests, and in their deep relation to human good. The arts would thus
recover their Homeric glory; touching human fate as they clearly would,
they would borrow something of its grandeur and pathos, and yet the
interest that worked in them would be warm, because it would remain
unmistakably animal and sincere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Only a rational society can have sure and perfect arts.</div>

<p>The principle that all institutions should subserve happiness runs
deeper than any cult for art and lays the foundation on which the latter
might rest safely. If social structure were rational its free expression
would be so too. Many observers, with no particular philosophy to
adduce, feel that <a name="Page_225" id="Page_225" />the arts among us are somehow impotent, and they look
for a better inspiration, now to ancient models, now to the raw
phenomena of life. A dilettante may, indeed, summon inspiration whence
he will; and a virtuoso will never lack some material to keep him busy;
but if what is hoped for is a genuine, native, inevitable art, a great
revolution would first have to be worked in society. We should have to
abandon our vested illusions, our irrational religions and patriotisms
and schools of art, and to discover instead our genuine needs, the forms
of our possible happiness. To call for such self-examination seems
revolutionary only because we start from a sophisticated system, a
system resting on traditional fashions and superstitions, by which the
will of the living generation is misinterpreted and betrayed. To shake
off that system would not subvert order but rather institute order for
the first time; it would be an <i>Instauratio Magna</i>, a setting things
again on their feet.</p>

<p>We in Christendom are so accustomed to artificial ideals and to
artificial institutions, kept up to express them, that we hardly
conceive how anomalous our situation is, sorely as we may suffer from
it. We found academies and museums, as we found missions, to fan a flame
that constantly threatens to die out for lack of natural fuel. Our overt
ideals are parasites in the body politic, while the ideals native to the
body politic, those involved in our natural struc<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226" />ture and situation,
are either stifled by that alien incubus, leaving civic life barbarous,
or else force their way up, unremarked or not justly honoured as ideals.
Industry and science and social amenities, with all the congruous
comforts and appurtenances of contemporary life, march on their way, as
if they had nothing to say to the spirit, which remains entangled in a
cobweb of dead traditions. An idle pottering of the fancy over obsolete
forms&mdash;theological, dramatic, or plastic&mdash;makes that by-play to the
sober business of life which men call their art or their religion; and
the more functionless and gratuitous this by-play is the more those who
indulge in it think they are idealists. They feel they are champions of
what is most precious in the world, as a sentimental lady might fancy
herself a lover of flowers when she pressed them in a book instead of
planting their seeds in the garden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why art is now empty and unstable.</div>

<p>It is clear that gratuitous and functionless habits cannot bring
happiness; they do not constitute an activity at once spontaneous and
beneficent, such as noble art is an instance of. Those habits may indeed
give pleasure; they may bring extreme excitement, as madness notably
does, though it is in the highest degree functionless and gratuitous.
Nor is such by-play without consequences, some of which might
conceivably be fortunate. What is functionless is so called for being
worthless from some ideal point of view, and not conducing to the
particu<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227" />lar life considered. But nothing real is dissociated from the
universal flux; everything&mdash;madness and all unmeaning cross-currents in
being&mdash;count in the general process and discharge somewhere, not without
effect, the substance they have drawn for a moment into their little
vortex. So our vain arts and unnecessary religions are not without real
effects and not without a certain internal vitality. When life is
profoundly disorganised it may well happen that only in detached
episodes, only in moments snatched for dreaming in, can men see the blue
or catch a glimpse of something like the ideal. In that case their
esteem for their irrelevant visions may be well grounded, and their thin
art and far-fetched religion may really constitute what is best in their
experience. In a pathetic way these poor enthusiasms may be justified,
but only because the very conception of a rational life lies entirely
beyond the horizon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anomalous character of the irrational artist.</div>

<p>It is no marvel, when art is a brief truancy from rational practice,
that the artist himself should be a vagrant, and at best, as it were, an
infant prodigy. The wings of genius serve him only for an escapade,
enabling him to skirt the perilous edge of madness and of mystical
abysses. But such an erratic workman does not deserve the name of artist
or master; he has burst convention only to break it, not to create a new
convention more in harmony with nature. His originality, though it may
astonish for a moment, will in the end be despised <a name="Page_228" id="Page_228" />and will find no
thoroughfare. He will meantime be wretched himself, torn from the roots
of his being by that cruel, unmeaning inspiration; or, if too rapt to
see his own plight, he will be all the more pitied by practical men, who
cannot think it a real blessing to be lost in joys that do not
strengthen the character and yield nothing for posterity.</p>

<p>Art, in its nobler acceptation, is an achievement, not an indulgence. It
prepares the world in some sense to receive the soul, and the soul to
master the world; it disentangles those threads in each that can be
woven into the other. That the artist should be eccentric, homeless,
dreamful may almost seem a natural law, but it is none the less a
scandal. An artist's business is not really to cut fantastical capers or
be licensed to play the fool. His business is simply that of every keen
soul to build well when it builds, and to speak well when it speaks,
giving practice everywhere the greatest possible affinity to the
situation, the most delicate adjustment to every faculty it affects. The
wonder of an artist's performance grows with the range of his
penetration, with the instinctive sympathy that makes him, in his mortal
isolation, considerate of other men's fate and a great diviner of their
secret, so that his work speaks to them kindly, with a deeper assurance
than they could have spoken with to themselves. And the joy of his great
sanity, the power of his adequate vision, is not the less intense
because he can lend it to others <a name="Page_229" id="Page_229" />and has borrowed it from a faithful
study of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">True art measures and completes happiness.</div>

<p>If happiness is the ultimate sanction of art, art in turn is the best
instrument of happiness. In art more directly than in other activities
man's self-expression is cumulative and finds an immediate reward; for
it alters the material conditions of sentience so that sentience becomes
at once more delightful and more significant. In industry man is still
servile, preparing the materials he is to use in action. In action
itself, though he is free, he exerts his influence on a living and
treacherous medium and sees the issue at each moment drift farther and
farther from his intent. In science he is an observer, preparing himself
for action in another way, by studying its results and conditions. But
in art he is at once competent and free; he is creative. He is not
troubled by his materials, because he has assimilated them and may take
them for granted; nor is he concerned with the chance complexion of
affairs in the actual world, because he is making the world over, not
merely considering how it grew or how it will consent to grow in future.
Nothing, accordingly, could be more delightful than genuine art, nor
more free from remorse and the sting of vanity. Art springs so
completely from the heart of man that it makes everything speak to him
in his own language; it reaches, nevertheless, so truly to the heart of
nature that it co-operates with her, becomes a parcel of her creative
material energy, <a name="Page_230" id="Page_230" />and builds by her instinctive hand. If the various
formative impulses afoot in the world never opposed stress to stress and
made no havoc with one another, nature might be called an unconscious
artist. In fact, just where such a formative impulse finds support from
the environment, a consciousness supervenes. If that consciousness is
adequate enough to be prophetic, an art arises. Thus the emergence of
arts out of instincts is the token and exact measure of nature's success
and of mortal happiness.</p>
