<p style='text-align: center;'>TYPES AND AIMS OF SCIENCE</p>


<div class="sidenote">Science still young.</div>

<p>Science is so new a thing and so far from final, it seems to the layman
so hopelessly accurate and extensive, that a moralist may well feel some
diffidence in trying to estimate its achievements and promises at their
human worth. The morrow may bring some great revolution in science, and
is sure to bring many a correction and many a surprise. Religion and art
have had their day; indeed a part of the faith they usually inspire is
to believe that they have long ago revealed their secret. A critic may
safely form a judgment concerning them; for even if he dissents from the
orthodox opinion and ventures to hope that religion and art may assume
in the future forms far nobler and more rational than any they have
hitherto worn, still he must confess that art and religion have had
several turns at the wheel; they have run their course through in
various ages and climes with results which anybody is free to estimate
if he has an open mind and sufficient interest in the subject. Science,
on the contrary, which apparently cannot exist where intellectual
freedom <a name="Page_4" id="Page_4" />is denied, has flourished only twice in recorded times: once
for some three hundred years in ancient Greece, and again for about the
same period in modern Christendom. Its fruits have scarcely begun to
appear; the lands it is discovering have not yet been circumnavigated,
and there is no telling what its ultimate influence will be on human
practice and feeling.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its miscarriage in Greece.</div>

<p>The first period in the life of science was brilliant but ineffectual.
The Greeks' energy and liberty were too soon spent, and the very
exuberance of their genius made its expression chaotic. Where every mind
was so fresh and every tongue so clever no scientific tradition could
arise, and no laborious applications could be made to test the value of
rival notions and decide between them. Men of science were mere
philosophers. Each began, not where his predecessor had ended, but at
the very beginning. Another circumstance that impeded the growth of
science was the forensic and rhetorical turn proper to Greek
intelligence. This mental habit gave a tremendous advantage in
philosophy to the moralist and poet over the naturalist or
mathematician. Hence what survived in Greece after the heyday of
theoretic achievement was chiefly philosophies of life, and these&mdash;at
the death of liberty&mdash;grew daily more personal and ascetic. Authority in
scientific matters clung chiefly to Plato and Aristotle, and this not
for the sake of their incomparable moral philosophy&mdash;for <a name="Page_5" id="Page_5" />in ethics that
decadent age preferred the Stoics and Epicureans&mdash;but just for those
rhetorical expedients which in the Socratic school took the place of
natural science. Worse influences in this field could hardly be
imagined, since Plato's physics ends in myth and apologue, while
Aristotle's ends in nomenclature and teleology.</p>

<p>All that remained of Greek physics, therefore, was the conception of
what physics should be&mdash;a great achievement due to the earlier
thinkers&mdash;and certain hints and guesses in that field. The elements of
geometry had also been formulated, while the Socratic school bequeathed
to posterity a well-developed group of moral sciences, rational in
principle, but destined to be soon overlaid with metaphysical and
religious accretions, so that the dialectical nerve and reasonableness
of them were obliterated, and there survived only miscellaneous
conclusions, fragments of wisdom built topsy-turvy into the new mythical
edifice. It is the sad task reserved for historical criticism to detach
those sculptured stones from the rough mass in which they have been
embedded and to rearrange them in their pristine order, thus
rediscovering the inner Socratic principle of moral philosophy, which is
nothing but self-knowledge&mdash;a circumspect, systematic utterance of the
speaker's mind, disclosing his implicit meaning and his ultimate
preferences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its timid reappearance in modern times.</div>

<p>At its second birth science took a very different form. It left cosmic
theories to pantheistic en<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6" />thusiasts like Giordano Bruno, while in sober
laborious circles it confined itself to specific discoveries&mdash;the
earth's roundness and motion about the sun, the laws of mechanics, the
development and application of algebra, the invention of the calculus,
and a hundred other steps forward in various disciplines. It was a
patient siege laid to the truth, which was approached blindly and
without a general, as by an army of ants; it was not stormed
imaginatively as by the ancient Ionians, who had reached at once the
notion of nature's dynamic unity, but had neglected to take possession
in detail of the intervening tracts, whence resources might be drawn in
order to maintain the main position.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as discoveries accumulated, they fell insensibly into a
system, and philosophers like Descartes and Newton arrived at a general
physics. This physics, however, was not yet meant to cover the whole
existent world, or to be the genetic account of all things in their
system. Descartes excluded from his physics the whole mental and moral
world, which became, so far as his science went, an inexplicable
addendum. Similarly Newton's mechanical principles, broad as they were,
were conceived by him merely as a parenthesis in theology. Not until the
nineteenth century were the observations that had been accumulated given
their full value or in fact understood; for Spinoza's system, though
naturalistic <a name="Page_7" id="Page_7" />in spirit, was still dialectical in form, and had no
influence on science and for a long time little even on speculation.</p>

<p>Indeed the conception of a natural order, like the Greek cosmos, which
shall include all existences&mdash;gods no less than men, if gods actually
exist&mdash;is one not yet current, although it is implied in every
scientific explanation and is favoured by two powerful contemporary
movements which, coming from different quarters, are leading men's minds
back to the same ancient and obvious naturalism. One of these movements
is the philosophy of evolution, to which Darwin gave such an
irresistible impetus. The other is theology itself, where it has been
emancipated from authority and has set to work to square men's
conscience with history and experience. This theology has generally
passed into speculative idealism, which under another name recognises
the universal empire of law and conceives man's life as an incident in a
prodigious natural process, by which his mind and his interests are
produced and devoured. This &quot;idealism&quot; is in truth a system of
immaterial physics, like that of Pythagoras or Heraclitus. While it
works with fantastic and shifting categories, which no plain naturalist
would care to use, it has nothing to apply those categories to except
what the naturalist or historian may already have discovered and
expressed in the categories of common prose. German idealism is a
translation of physical evolution into <a name="Page_8" id="Page_8" />mythical language, which
presents the facts now in the guise of a dialectical progression, now in
that of a romantic drama. In either case the facts are the same, and
just those which positive knowledge has come upon. Thus many who are not
brought to naturalism by science are brought to it, quite unwillingly
and unawares, by their religious speculations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distinction between science and myth.</div>

<p>The gulf that yawns between such idealistic cosmogonies and a true
physics may serve to make clear the divergence in principle which
everywhere divides natural science from arbitrary conceptions of things.
This divergence is as far as possible from lying in the merit of the two
sorts of theory. Their merit, and the genius and observation required to
frame them, may well be equal, or an imaginative system may have the
advantage in these respects. It may even be more serviceable for a while
and have greater pragmatic value, so long as knowledge is at best
fragmentary, and no consecutive or total view of things is attempted by
either party. Thus in social life a psychology expressed in terms of
abstract faculties and personified passions may well carry a man farther
than a physiological psychology would. Or, again, we may say that there
was more experience and love of nature enshrined in ancient mythology
than in ancient physics; the observant poet might then have fared better
in the world than the pert and ignorant materialist. Nor does <a name="Page_9" id="Page_9" />the
difference between science and myth lie in the fact that the one is
essentially less speculative than the other. They are differently
speculative, it is true, since myth terminates in unverifiable notions
that might by chance represent actual existences; while science
terminates in concepts or laws, themselves not possibly existent, but
verified by recurring particular facts, belonging to the same experience
as those from which the theory started.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Platonic status of hypothesis.</div>

<p>The laws formulated by science&mdash;the transitive figments describing the
relation between fact and fact&mdash;possess only a Platonic sort of reality.
They are more real, if you will, than the facts themselves, because they
are more permanent, trustworthy, and pervasive; but at the same time
they are, if you will, not real at all, because they are incompatible
with immediacy and alien to brute existence. In declaring what is true
of existences they altogether renounce existence on their own behalf.
This situation has made no end of trouble in ill-balanced minds, not
docile to the diversities and free complexity of things, but bent on
treating everything by a single method. They have asked themselves
persistently the confusing question whether the matter or the form of
things is the reality; whereas, of course, both elements are needed,
each with its incommensurable kind of being. The material element alone
is existent, while the ideal element is the sum of all those
propositions which are true of what exists mate<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10" />rially. Anybody's
<i>knowledge</i> of the truth, being a complex and fleeting feeling, is of
course but a moment of existence or material being, which whether found
in God or man is as far as possible from being that truth itself which
it may succeed in knowing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meaning of verification.</div>

<p>The true contrast between science and myth is more nearly touched when
we say that science alone is capable of verification. Some ambiguity,
however, lurks in this phrase, since verification comes to a method only
vicariously, when the particulars it prophesies are realised in sense.
To verify a theory as if it were not a method but a divination of occult
existences would be to turn the theory into a myth and then to discover
that what the myth pictured had, by a miracle, an actual existence also.
There is accordingly a sense in which myth admits substantiation of a
kind that science excludes. The Olympic hierarchy might conceivably
exist bodily; but gravitation and natural selection, being schemes of
relation, can never exist substantially and on their own behoof.
Nevertheless, the Olympic hierarchy, even if it happened to exist, could
not be proved to do so unless it were a part of the natural world open
to sense; while gravitation and natural selection, without being
existences, can be verified at every moment by concrete events occurring
as those principles require. A hypothesis, being a discursive device,
gains its utmost possible validity when its discur<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11" />sive value is
established. It <i>is</i> not, it merely <i>applies</i>; and every situation in
which it is found to apply is a proof of its truth.</p>

<p>The case would not be different with fables, were their basis and
meaning remembered. But fables, when hypostatised, forget that they,
too, were transitive symbols and boast to reveal an undiscoverable
reality. A dogmatic myth is in this sorry plight: that the more evidence
it can find to support it the more it abrogates its metaphysical
pretensions, while the more it insists on its absolute truth the less
relevance it has to experience and the less meaning. To try to support
fabulous dogmas by evidence is tantamount to acknowledging that they are
merely scientific hypotheses, instruments of discourse, and methods of
expression. But in that case their truth would no longer be supposed to
lie in the fact that somewhere beyond the range of human observation
they descended bodily to the plane of flying existence, and were
actually enacted there. They would have ceased to resemble the society
of Olympus, which to prove itself real would need to verify itself,
since only the gods and those mortals admitted to their conclave could
know for a fact that that celestial gathering existed. On the contrary,
a speculation that could be supported by evidence would be one that
might be made good without itself descending to the plane of immediacy,
but would be sufficiently verified when diffuse facts fall out as it had
led us to expect. <a name="Page_12" id="Page_12" />The myth in such a case would have become transparent
again and relevant to experience, which could continually serve to
support or to correct it. Even if somewhat overloaded and poetical, it
would be in essence a scientific theory. It would no longer terminate in
itself; it would point forward, leading the thinker that used it to
eventual facts of experience, facts which his poetic wisdom would have
prepared him to meet and to use.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Possible validity of myths.</div>

<p>If I say, for instance, that Punishment, limping in one leg, patiently
follows every criminal, the myth is obvious and innocent enough. It
reveals nothing, but, what is far better, it means something. I have
expressed a truth of experience and pointed vaguely to the course which
events may be expected to take under given circumstances. The
expression, though mythical in form, is scientific in effect, because it
tends to surround a given phenomenon (the crime) with objects on its own
plane&mdash;other passions and sensations to follow upon it. What would be
truly mythical would be to stop at the figure of speech and maintain, by
way of revealed dogma, that a lame goddess of vindictive mind actually
follows every wicked man, her sword poised in mid-air. Sinking into that
reverie, and trembling at its painted truth, I should be passing to the
undiscoverable and forgetting the hard blows actually awaiting me in the
world. Fable, detaining the mind too <a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" />long in the mesh of expression,
would have become metaphysical dogma. I should have connected the given
fact with imagined facts, which even if by chance real&mdash;for such a
goddess may, for all we know, actually float in the fourth
dimension&mdash;are quite supernumerary in my world, and never, by any
possibility, can become parts or extensions of the experience they are
thought to explain. The gods are demonstrable only as hypotheses, but as
hypotheses they are not gods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Any dreamed-of thing might be experienced.</div>

<p>The same distinction is sometimes expressed by saying that science deals
only with objects of possible experience. But this expression is
unfortunate, because everything thinkable, no matter how mythical and
supernatural or how far beyond the range of mortal senses, is an object
of <i>possible</i> experience. Tritons and sea-horses might observe one
another and might feel themselves live. The thoughts and decrees said to
occupy the divine mind from all eternity would certainly be phenomena
there; they would be experienced things. Were fables really as
metaphysical and visionary as they pretend to be, were they not all the
while and in essence mere symbols for natural situations, they would be
nothing but reports about other alleged parts of experience. A real
Triton, a real Creator, a real heaven would obviously be objects open to
properly equipped senses and seats of much vivid experience. But a
Triton after all has something to do with the &AElig;gean and other <a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" />earthly
waters; a Creator has something to do with the origin of man and of his
habitat; heaven has something to do with the motives and rewards of
moral action. This relevance to given experience and its objects is what
cuts those myths off from their blameless and gratuitous r&ocirc;le of
reporting experiences that might be going on merrily enough somewhere
else in the universe. In calling them myths and denying that what they
describe falls within the purview of science, we do not assert that,
absolutely taken, they could not be objects of a possible experience.
What we mean is rather that no matter how long we searched the sea
waves, in which it is the essence of our Tritons to disport themselves,
we should never find Tritons there; and that if we traced back the
history of man and nature we should find them always passing by natural
generation out of slightly different earlier forms and never appearing
suddenly, at the fiat of a vehement Jehovah swimming about in a chaos;
and finally that if we considered critically our motives and our ideals,
we should find them springing from and directed upon a natural life and
its functions, and not at all on a disembodied and timeless ecstasy.
Those myths, then, while they intrinsically refer to facts in the given
world, describe those facts in incongruous terms. They are symbols, not
extensions, for the experience we know.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But science follows the movement of its subject-matter.</div>

<p>A chief characteristic of science, then, is that in supplementing given
facts it supplements them <a name="Page_15" id="Page_15" />by adding other facts belonging to the same
sphere, and eventually discoverable by tracing the given object in its
own plane through its continuous transformations. Science expands
speculatively, by the aid of merely instrumental hypotheses, objects
given in perception until they compose a congruous, self-supporting
world, all parts of which might be observed consecutively. What a
scientific hypothesis interpolates among the given facts&mdash;the atomic
structure of things, for instance&mdash;might come in time under the direct
fire of attention, fixed more scrupulously, longer, or with better
instruments upon those facts themselves. Otherwise the hypothesis that
assumed that structure would be simply false, just as a hypothesis that
the interior of the earth is full of molten fire would be false if on
inspection nothing were found there but solid rock. Science does not
merely prolong a habit of inference; it verifies and solves the
inference by reaching the fact inferred.</p>

<p>The contrast with myth at this point is very interesting; for in myth
the facts are themselves made vehicles, and knowledge is felt to
terminate in an independent existence on a higher or deeper level than
any immediate fact; and this circumstance is what makes myth impossible
to verify and, except by laughter, to disprove. If I attributed the
stars' shining to the diligence of angels who lighted their lamps at
sunset, lest the upper <a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" />reaches of the world should grow dangerous for
travellers, and if I made my romance elaborate and ingenious enough, I
might possibly find that the stars' appearance and disappearance could
continue to be interpreted in that way. My myth might always suggest
itself afresh and might be perennially appropriate. But it would never
descend, with its charming figures, into the company of its evidences.
It would never prove that what it terminated in was a fact, as in my
metaphysical faith I had deputed and asserted it to be. The angels would
remain notional, while my intent was to have them exist; so that the
more earnestly I held to my fable the more grievously should I be
deceived. For even if seraphic choirs existed in plenty on their own
emotional or musical plane of being, it would not have been their
hands&mdash;if they had hands&mdash;that would have lighted the stars I saw; and
this, after all, was the gist and starting-point of my whole fable and
its sole witness in my world. A myth might by chance be a revelation,
did what it talks of have an actual existence somewhere else in the
universe; but it would need to be a revelation in order to be true at
all, and would then be true only in an undeserved and spurious fashion.
Any representative and provable validity which it might possess would
assimulate it to science and reduce it to a mere vehicle and instrument
for human discourse. It would evaporate as soon as the prophecies it
made were fulfilled, and it would claim no being and no wor<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" />ship on its
own account. Science might accordingly be called a myth conscious of its
essential ideality, reduced to its fighting weight and valued only for
its significance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral value of science.</div>

<p>A symptom of the divergence between myth and science may be found in the
contrary emotions which they involve. Since in myth we interpret
experience in order to interpret it, in order to delight ourselves by
turning it poetically into the language and prosody of our own life, the
emotion we feel when we succeed is artistic; myth has a dramatic charm.
Since in science, on the contrary, we employ notional machinery, in
itself perhaps indifferent enough, in order to arrive at eventual facts
and to conceive the aspect which given things would actually wear from a
different point of view in space or time, the emotion we feel when we
succeed is that of security and intellectual dominion; science has a
rational value. To see better what we now see, to see by anticipation
what we should see actually under other conditions, is wonderfully to
satisfy curiosity and to enlighten conduct. At the same time, scientific
thinking involves no less inward excitement than dramatic fiction does.
It summons before us an even larger number of objects in their fatal
direction upon our interests. Were science adequate it would indeed
absorb those passions which now, since they must be satisfied somehow,
have to be satisfied by dramatic myths. To imagine how things might have
been would <a name="Page_18" id="Page_18" />be neither interesting nor possible if we knew fully how
things are. All pertinent dramatic emotion, joyous or tragic, would then
inhere in practical knowledge. As it is, however, science abstracts from
the more musical overtones of things in order to trace the gross and
basal processes within them; so that the pursuit of science seems
comparatively dry and laborious, except where at moments the vista opens
through to the ultimate or leads back to the immediate. Then, perhaps,
we recognise that in science we are surveying all it concerns us to
know, and in so doing are becoming all that it profits us to be. Mere
amusement in thought as in sportive action is tedious and illiberal: it
marks a temperament so imperfectly educated that it prefers idle to
significant play and a flimsy to a solid idea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its continuity with common knowledge.</div>

<p>The fact that science follows the subject-matter in its own movement
involves a further consequence: science differs from common knowledge in
scope only, not in nature. When intelligence arises, when the flux of
things begins to be mitigated by representation of it and objects are at
last fixed and recognisable, there is science. For even here, in the
presence of a datum something virtual and potential is called up,
namely, what the given thing was a moment ago, what it is growing into,
or what it is contrasted with in character. As I walk round a tree, I
learn that the parts still visible, those that have just dis<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" />appeared
and those now coming into view, are continuous and belong to the same
tree.</p>

<p>This declaration, though dialectic might find many a mare's nest in its
language, is a safe and obvious enough expression of knowledge. It
involves terms, however, which are in the act of becoming potential.
What is just past, what is just coming, though sensibly continuous with
what is present, are partially infected with nonentity. After a while
human apprehension can reach them only by inference, and to count upon
them is frankly to rely on theory. The other side of the tree, which
common sense affirms to exist unconditionally, will have to be
represented in memory or fancy; and it may never actually be observed by
any mortal. Yet, if I continued my round, I should actually observe it
and know it by experience; and I should find that it had the same status
as the parts now seen, and was continuous with them. My assertion that
it exists, while certainly theoretical and perhaps false, is accordingly
scientific in type. Science, when it has no more scope than this, is
indistinguishable from common sense. The two become distinct only when
the facts inferred cannot be easily verified or have not yet been merged
with the notion representing the given object in most men's minds.</p>

<p>Where science remains consciously theoretical (being as yet contrasted
with ordinary apperception and current thought), it is, ideally
considered, a <i>pis aller</i>, an expedient to which a mind <a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" />must have
recourse when it lacks power and scope to hold all experience in hand
and to view the wide world in its genuine immediacy. As oblivescence is
a gradual death, proper to a being not ideally master of the universal
flux, but swamped within it, so science is an artificial life, in which
what cannot be perceived directly (because personal limitations forbid)
may be regarded abstractly, yet efficaciously, in what we think and do.
With better faculties the field of possible experience could be better
dominated, and fewer of its parts, being hidden from sight, would need
to be mapped out symbolically on that sort of projection which we call
scientific inference. The real relations between the parts of nature
would then be given in intuition, from which hypothesis, after all, has
borrowed its schemata.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its intellectual essence.</div>

<p>Science is a half-way house between private sensation and universal
vision. We should not forget to add, however, that the universal vision
in question, if it were to be something better than private sensation or
passive feeling in greater bulk, would have to be intellectual, just as
science is; that is, it would have to be practical and to survey the
flux from a given standpoint, in a perspective determined by special and
local interests. Otherwise the whole world, when known, would merely be
re-enacted in its blind immediacy without being understood or subjected
to any purpose. The critics of science, when endowed with any
speculative power, <a name="Page_21" id="Page_21" />have always seen that what is hypothetical and
abstract in scientific method is somehow servile and provisional;
science being a sort of telegraphic wire through which a meagre report
reaches us of things we would fain observe and live through in their
full reality. This report may suffice for approximately fit action; it
does not suffice for ideal knowledge of the truth nor for adequate
sympathy with the reality. What commonly escapes speculative critics of
science, however, is that in transcending hypothesis and reaching
immediacy again we should run a great risk of abandoning knowledge and
sympathy altogether; for if we <i>became</i> what we now represent so
imperfectly, we should evidently no longer represent it at all. We
should not, at the end of our labours, have at all enriched our own
minds by adequate knowledge of what surrounds us, nor made our wills
just in view of alien but well-considered interests. We should have lost
our own essence and substituted for it, not something higher than
indiscriminate being, but only indiscriminate being in its flat, blind,
and selfish infinity. The ideality, the representative faculty, would
have gone out in our souls, and our perfected humanity would have
brought us back to protoplasm.</p>

<p>In transcending science, therefore, we must not hope to transcend
knowledge, nor in transcending selfishness to abolish finitude. Finitude
is the indispensable condition of unselfishness as well as <a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" />of
selfishness, and of speculative vision no less than of hypothetical
knowledge. The defect of science is that it is inadequate or abstract,
that the account it gives of things is not full and sensuous enough; but
its merit is that, like sense, it makes external being present to a
creature that is concerned in adjusting itself to its environment, and
informs that creature about things other than itself. Science, if
brought to perfection, would not lose its representative or ideal
essence. It would still survey and inform, but it would survey
everything at once and inform the being it enlightened about all that
could affect its interests. It would thus remain practical in effect and
speculative in character. In losing its accidental limitations it would
not lose its initial bias, its vital function. It would continue to be a
rational activity, guiding and perfecting a natural being.</p>

<p>Perfect knowledge of things would be as far as possible from identifying
the knower with them, seeing that for the most part&mdash;even when we call
them human&mdash;they have no knowledge of themselves. Science, accordingly,
even when imperfect, is a tremendous advance on absorption in sense and
a dull immediacy. It begins to enrich the mind and gives it some
inkling, at least, of that ideal dominion which each centre of
experience might have if it had learned to regard all others, and the
relation connecting it with them, both in thought and in action. Ideal
knowledge <a name="Page_23" id="Page_23" />would be an inward state corresponding to a perfect
adjustment of the body to all forces affecting it. If the adjustment was
perfect the inward state would regard every detail in the objects
envisaged, but it would see those details in a perspective of its own,
adding to sympathetic reproduction of them a consciousness of their
relation to its own existence and perfection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unity of science.</div>

<p>The fact that science expresses the character and relation of objects in
their own terms has a further important consequence, which serves again
to distinguish science from metaphorical thinking. If a man tries to
illustrate the nature of a thing by assimilating it to something else
which he happens to have in mind at the same time, it is obvious that a
second man, whose mind is differently furnished, may assimilate the same
object to a quite different idea: so myths are centrifugal, and the more
elaborate and delicate they are the more they diverge, like
well-developed languages. The rude beginnings of myth in every age and
country bear a certain resemblance, because the facts interpreted are
similar and the minds reading them have not yet developed their special
grammar of representation. But two highly developed mythical
systems&mdash;two theologies, for instance, like the Greek and the
Indian&mdash;will grow every day farther and farther apart. Science, on the
contrary, whatever it may start with, runs back into the same circle of
facts, because it follows the lead of the <a name="Page_24" id="Page_24" />subject-matter, and is
attentive to its inherent transformations.</p>

<p>If men's fund of initial perceptions, then, is alike, their science is
sure to be so; while the embroideries they make upon perception out of
their own resources will differ as much as do the men themselves. Men
asleep, said Heraclitus, live each in his own world, but awake they live
in the same world together. To be awake is nothing but to be dreaming
under control of the object; it is to be pursuing science to the
comparative exclusion of mere mental vegetation and spontaneous myth.
Thus if our objects are the same, our science and our waking lives will
coincide; or if there is a natural diversity in our discoveries, because
we occupy different points in space and time and have a varying range of
experience, these diversities will nevertheless supplement one another;
the discovery that each has made will be a possible discovery for the
others also. So a geographer in China and one in Babylonia may at first
make wholly unlike maps; but in time both will take note of the
Himalayas, and the side each approaches will slope up to the very crest
approached by the other. So science is self-confirming, and its most
disparate branches are mutually illuminating; while in the realm of
myth, until it is surveyed scientifically, there can be nothing but
mutual repulsion and incapacity to understand. Languages and religions
are necessarily rivals, but sciences are necessarily allies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25" />In existence, judged by reflection, there is a margin of
waste.</div>

<p>The unity of science can reach no farther than does coherent experience;
and though coherence be a condition of experience in the more pregnant
sense of the word&mdash;in the sense in which the child or the fool has no
experience&mdash;existence is absolutely free to bloom as it likes, and no
logic can set limits or prescribe times for its irresponsible presence.
A great deal may accordingly exist which cannot be known by science, or
be reached from the outside at all. This fact perhaps explains why
science has as yet taken so little root in human life: for even within
the limits of human existence, which are tolerably narrow, there is
probably no little incoherence, no little lapsing into what, from any
other point of view, is inconceivable and undiscoverable. Science, for
instance, can hardly reach the catastrophes and delights, often so
vivid, which occur in dreams; for even if a physiological psychology
should some day be able to find the causes of these phenomena, and so to
predict them, it would never enter the dream-world persuasively, in a
way that the dreamer could appreciate and understand, while he continued
to dream. This is because that dream-world and the waking world present
two disjointed landscapes, and the figures they contain belong to quite
different genealogies&mdash;like the families of Zeus and of Abraham. Science
is a great disciplinarian, and misses much of the sport which the
absolute is free to indulge in. If <a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" />there is no inner congruity and
communion between two fields, science cannot survey them both; at best
in tracing the structure of things presented in one of them, it may come
upon some detail which may offer a basis or lodgment for the entire
fabric of the other, which will thus be explained <i>ab extra</i>; as the
children of Abraham might give an explanation for Zeus and his progeny,
treating them as a phenomenon in the benighted minds of some of Japhet's
children.</p>

<p>This brings the Olympian world within the purview of science, but does
so with a very bad grace. For suppose the Olympian gods really
existed&mdash;and there is nothing impossible in that supposition&mdash;they would
not be allowed to have any science of their own; or if they did, it
would threaten the children of Abraham with the same imputed unreality
with which the latter boast to have extinguished Olympus. In order,
then, that two regions of existence should be amenable to a science
common to both and establishing a mutual rational representation between
them, it is requisite that the two regions should be congruous in
texture and continuous inwardly: the objects present in each must be
transformations of the objects present in the other. As this condition
is not always fulfilled, even within a man's personal fortunes, it is
impossible that all he goes through should be mastered by science or
should accrue to him ideally and become part of his funded experience.
Much must be lost, left to <a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" />itself, and resigned to the unprofitable
flux that produced it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sciences converge from different points of origin.</div>

<p>A consequence of this incoherence in experience is that science is not
absolutely single but springs up in various places at once, as a certain
consistency or method becomes visible in this or that direction. These
independent sciences might, conceivably, never meet at all; each might
work out an entirely different aspect of things and cross the other, as
it were, at a different level. This actually happens, for instance, in
mathematics as compared with history or psychology, and in morals as
compared with physics. Nevertheless, the fact that these various
sciences are all human, and that here, for instance, we are able to
mention them in one breath and to compare their natures, is proof that
their spheres touch somehow, even if only peripherally. Since common
knowledge, which knows of them all, is itself an incipient science, we
may be sure that some continuity and some congruity obtains between
their provinces. Some aspect of each must coincide with some aspect of
some other, else nobody who pursued any one science would so much as
suspect the existence of the rest. Great as may be the aversion of
learned men to one another, and comprehensive as may be their ignorance,
they are not positively compelled to live in solitary confinement, and
the key of their prison cells is at least in their own pocket.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" />Two chief kinds of science, physics and dialectic.</div>

<p>Some sciences, like chemistry and biology, or biology and anthropology,
are parted only, we presume, by accidental gaps in human knowledge; a
more minute and better directed study of these fields would doubtless
disclose their continuity with the fields adjoining. But there is one
general division in science which cuts almost to the roots of human
experience. Human understanding has used from the beginning a double
method of surveying and arresting ideally the irreparable flux of being.
One expedient has been to notice and identify similarities of character,
recurrent types, in the phenomena that pass before it or in its own
operations; the other expedient has been to note and combine in one
complex object characters which occur and reappear together. The latter
feat which is made easy by the fact that when various senses are
stimulated at once the inward instinctive reaction&mdash;which is felt by a
primitive mind more powerfully than any external image&mdash;is one and not
consciously divisible.</p>

<p>The first expedient imposes on the flux what we call ideas, which are
concretions in discourse, terms employed in thought and language. The
second expedient separates the same flux into what we call things, which
are concretions in existence, complexes of qualities subsisting in space
and time, having definable dynamic relations there and a traceable
history. Carrying out this primi<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29" />tive diversity in reflection science
has moved in two different directions. By refining concretions in
discourse it has attained to mathematics, logic, and the dialectical
developments of ethics; by tracing concretions in existence it has
reached the various natural and historical sciences. Following ancient
usage, I shall take the liberty of calling the whole group of sciences
which elaborates ideas <i>dialectic</i>, and the whole group that describes
existences <i>physics</i>.</p>

<p>The contrast between ideal science or dialectic and natural science or
physics is as great as the understanding of a single experience could
well afford; yet the two kinds of science are far from independent. They
touch at their basis and they co-operate in their results. Were
dialectic made clearer or physics deeper than it commonly is, these
points of contact would doubtless be multiplied; but even as they stand
they furnish a sufficient illustration of the principle that all science
develops objects in their own category and gives the mind dominion over
the flux of matter by discovering its form.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their mutual implication.</div>

<p>That physics and dialectic touch at their basis may be shown by a double
analysis. In the first place, it is clear that the science of existence,
like all science, is itself discourse, and that before concretions in
existence can be discovered, and groups of coexistent qualities can be
recognised, these qualities themselves must be arrested by the mind,
noted, and identi<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" />fied in their recurrences. But these terms, bandied
about in scientific discourse, are so many essences and pure ideas: so
that the inmost texture of natural science is logical, and the whole
force of any observation made upon the outer world lies in the constancy
and mutual relations of the terms it is made in. If down did not mean
down and motion motion, Newton could never have taken note of the fall
of his apple. Now the constancy and relation of meanings is something
<i>meant</i>, it is something created by insight and intent and is altogether
dialectical; so that the science of existence is a portion of the art of
discourse.</p>

<p>On the other hand discourse, in its operation, is a part of existence.
That truth or logical cogency is not itself an existence can be proved
dialectically,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1" /><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and is obvious to any one who sees <a name="Page_31" id="Page_31" />for a moment what
truth means, especially if he remembers at the same time that all
existence is mutable, which it is the essence of truth not to be. But
the knowledge or discovery of truth is an event in time, an incident in
the flux of existence, and therefore a matter for natural science to
study.</p>

<p>Furthermore, every term which dialectic uses is originally given
embodied; in other words, it is given as an element in the actual flux,
it conies by illustration. Though meaning is the object of an ideal
function, and signification is inwardly appreciable only in terms of
signification, yet the ideal leap is made from a material datum: that in
which signification is seen is a fact. Or to state the matter somewhat
differently, truth is not self-generating; if it were it would be a
falsehood.</p>

<p><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32" />Its eternity, and the infinitude of propositions it contains, remain
potential and unapproachable until their incidence is found in
existence. Form cannot of itself decide which of all possible forms
shall be real; in their ideality, and without reference to their
illustration in things, all consistent propositions would be equally
valid and equally trivial. Important truth is truth about something, not
truth about truth; and although a single datum might suffice to give
foothold and pertinence to an infinity of truths, as one atom would
posit all geometry, geometry, if there were no space, would be, if I may
say so, all of the fourth dimension, and arithmetic, if there were no
pulses or chasms in being, would be all algebra. Truth depends upon
facts for its perspective, since facts select truths and decide which
truths shall be mere possibilities and which shall be the eternal forms
of actual things. The dialectical world would be a trackless desert if
the existent world had no arbitrary constitution. Living dialectic comes
to clarify existence; it turns into meanings the actual forms of things
by reflecting upon them, and by making them intended subjects of
discourse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their co-operation.</div>

<p>Dialectic and physics, thus united at their basis, meet again in their
results. In mechanical science, which is the best part of physics,
mathematics, which is the best part of dialectic, plays a predominant
r&ocirc;le; it furnishes the whole method of understanding <a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" />wherever there is
any real understanding at all. In psychology and history, too, although
dialectic is soon choked by the cross-currents of nature, it furnishes
the little perspicuousness which there is. We understand actions and
mental developments when the purposes or ideas contained in any stage
are carried out logically in the sequel; it is when conduct and growth
are rational, that is, when they are dialectical, that we think we have
found the true secret and significance of them. It is the evident ideal
of physics, in every department, to attain such an insight into causes
that the effects actually given may be thence <i>deduced</i>; and deduction
is another name for dialectic. To be sure, the dialectic applicable to
material processes and to human life is one in which the terms and the
categories needed are still exceedingly numerous and vague: a little
logic is all that can be read into the cataract of events. But the hope
of science, a hope which is supported by every success it scores, is
that a simpler law than has yet been discovered will be found to connect
units subtler than those yet known; and that in these finer terms the
universal mechanism may be exhaustively rendered. Mechanism is the ideal
of physics, because it is the infusion of a maximum of mathematical
necessity into the flux of real things. It is the aspiration of natural
science to be as dialectical as possible, and thus, in their ideal, both
branches of science are brought together.</p>

<p><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34" />That the ideal of dialectic is to apply to existence and thereby to
coincide with physics is in a sense no less true, although dialecticians
may be little inclined to confess it. The direct purpose of deduction is
to elucidate an idea, to develop an import, and nothing can be more
irrelevant in this science than whether the conclusion is verified in
nature or not. But the direct purpose of dialectic is not its ultimate
justification. Dialectic is a human pursuit and has, at bottom, a moral
function; otherwise, at bottom, it would have no value. And the moral
function and ultimate justification of dialectic is to further the Life
of Reason, in which human thought has the maximum practical validity,
and may enjoy in consequence the richest ideal development. If dialectic
takes a turn which makes it inapplicable in physics, which makes it
worthless for mastering experience, it loses all its dignity: for
abstract cogency has no dignity if the subject-matter into which it is
introduced is trivial. In fact, were dialectic a game in which the
counters were not actual data and the conclusions were not possible
principles for understanding existence, it would not be a science at
all. It would resemble a counterfeit paper currency, without intrinsic
value and without commercial convenience. Just as a fact without
implications is not a part of science, so a method without application
would not be.</p>

<p>The free excursions of dialectic into non-natural regions may be wisely
encouraged when they <a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" />satisfy an interest which is at bottom healthy and
may, at least indirectly, bring with it excellent fruits. As musicians
are an honour to society, so are dialecticians that have a single heart
and an exquisite patience. But somehow the benefit must redound to
society and to practical knowledge, or these abstracted hermits will
seem at first useless and at last mad. The logic of nonsense has a
subtle charm only because it can so easily be turned into the logic of
common sense. Empty dialectic is, as it were, the ballet of science: it
runs most neatly after nothing at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No science <i>a priori</i>.</div>

<p>Both physics and dialectic are contained in common knowledge, and when
carried further than men carry them daily life these sciences remain
essentially inevitable and essentially fallible. If science deserves
respect, it is not for being oracular but for being useful and
delightful, as seeing is. Understanding is nothing but seeing under and
seeing far. There is indeed a great mystery in knowledge, but this
mystery is present in the simplest memory or presumption. The sciences
have nothing to supply more fundamental than vulgar thinking or, as it
were, preliminary to it. They are simply elaborations of it; they accept
its pre-suppositions and carry on its ordinary processes. A pretence on
the philosopher's part that he could get behind or below human thinking,
that he could underpin, so to speak, his own childhood and the inherent
conventions of daily thought, would be <a name="Page_36" id="Page_36" />pure imposture. A philosopher
can of course investigate the history of knowledge, he can analyse its
method and point out its assumptions; but he cannot know by other
authority than that which the vulgar know by, nor can his knowledge
begin with other unheard-of objects or deploy itself in advance over an
esoteric field. Every deeper investigation presupposes ordinary
perception and uses some at least of its data. Every possible discovery
<i>extends</i> human knowledge. None can base human knowledge anew on a
deeper foundation or prefix an ante-experimental episode to experience.
We may construct a theory as disintegrating as we please about the
dialectical or empirical conditions of the experience given; we may
disclose its logical stratification or physical antecedents; but every
idea and principle used in such a theory must be borrowed from current
knowledge as it happens to lie in the philosopher's mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Role of criticism.</div>

<p>If these speculative adventures do not turn out well, the scientific man
is free to turn about and become the critic and satirist of his foiled
ambitions. He may exhaust scepticism and withdraw into the citadel of
immediate feeling, yielding bastion after bastion to the assaults of
doubt. When he is at last perfectly safe from error and reduced to
speechless sensibility, he will perceive, however, that he is also
washed clean of every practical belief: he would declare himself
universally ignorant but for a doubt whether there be really anything to
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" />know. This metaphysical exercise is simply one of those &quot;fallings from
us, vanishings, blank misgivings of a creature moving about in worlds
not realised&quot; which may visit any child. So long as the suspension of
judgment lasts, knowledge is surely not increased; but when we remember
that the enemy to whom we have surrendered is but a ghost of our own
evoking, we easily reoccupy the lost ground and fall back into an
ordinary posture of belief and expectation. This recovered faith has no
new evidences to rest on. We simply stand where we stood before we began
to philosophise, only with a better knowledge of the lines we are
holding and perhaps with less inclination to give them up again for no
better reason than the undoubted fact that, in a speculative sense, it
is always possible to renounce them.</p>

<p>Science, then, is the attentive consideration of common experience; it
is common knowledge extended and refined. Its validity is of the same
order as that of ordinary perception, memory, and understanding. Its
test is found, like theirs, in actual intuition, which sometimes
consists in perception and sometimes in intent. The flight of science is
merely longer from perception to perception, and its deduction more
accurate of meaning from meaning and purpose from purpose. It generates
in the mind, for each vulgar observation, a whole brood of suggestions,
hypotheses, and inferences. The sciences bestow, as is right and
fitting, infinite pains upon that experience <a name="Page_38" id="Page_38" />which in their absence
would drift by unchallenged or misunderstood. They take note, infer, and
prophesy. They compare prophecy with event; and altogether they
supply&mdash;so intent are they on reality&mdash;every imaginable background and
extension for the present dream.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1" /><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> For instance, in Plato's &quot;Parmenides,&quot; where it is shown
that the ideas are not in the mind. We may gather from what is there
said that the ideas cannot be identified with any embodiment of them,
however perfect, since an idea means a nature common to all its possible
embodiments and remains always outside of them. This is what Plato meant
by saying that the ideas lay apart from phenomena and were what they
were in and for themselves. They were mere forms and not, as a
materialised Platonism afterward fancied, images in the mind of some
psychological deity. The gods doubtless know the ideas, as Plato tells
us in the same place: these are the common object of their thought and
of ours; hence they are not anybody's thinking process, which of course
would be in flux and phenomenal. Only by being ideal (<i>i.e.</i>, by being a
goal of intellectual energy and no part of sensuous existence) can a
term be common to various minds and serve to make their deliverances
pertinent to one another.
</p><p>
That truth is no existence might also be proved as follows: Suppose that
nothing existed or (if critics carp at that phrase), that a universe did
not exist. It would then be true that all existences were wanting, yet
this truth itself would endure; therefore truth is not an existence. An
attempt might be made to reverse this argument by saying that since it
would still &quot;be&quot; true that nothing existed, the supposition is
self-contradictory, for the truth would &quot;be&quot; or exist in any case. Truth
would thus be turned into an opinion, supposed to subsist eternally in
the ether. The argument, however, is a bad sophism, because it falsifies
the intent of the terms used. Somebody's opinion is not what is meant by
the truth, since every opinion, however long-lived, may be false.
Furthermore, the notion that it might have been true that nothing
existed is a perfectly clear notion. The nature of dialectic is entirely
corrupted when sincerity is lost. No intent can be self-contradictory,
since it fixes its own object, but a man may easily contradict himself
by wavering between one intent and another.</p></div>

<p style='text-align: center;'>HISTORY</p>


<div class="sidenote">History an artificial memory.</div>

<p>The least artificial extension of common knowledge is history. Personal
recollection supplies many an anecdote, anecdotes collected and freely
commented upon make up memoirs, and memoirs happily combined make not
the least interesting sort of history. When a man recalls any episode in
his career, describes the men that flourished in his youth, or laments
the changes that have since taken place, he is an informal historian. He
would become one in a formal and technical sense if he supplemented and
controlled his memory by ransacking papers, and taking elaborate pains
to gather evidence on the events he wished to relate. This systematic
investigation, especially when it goes back to first sources, widens the
basis for imaginative reconstruction. It buttresses somewhat the frail
body of casual facts that in the first instance may have engaged an
individual's attention.</p>

<p>History is nothing but assisted and recorded memory. It might almost be
said to be no science at all, if memory and faith in memory were not
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40" />what science necessarily rests on. In order to sift evidence we must
rely on some witness, and we must trust experience before we proceed to
expand it. The line between what is known scientifically and what has
to be assumed in order to support that knowledge is impossible to draw.
Memory itself is an internal rumour; and when to this hearsay within the
mind we add the falsified echoes that reach us from others, we have but
a shifting and unseizable basis to build upon. The picture we frame of
the past changes continually and grows every day less similar to the
original experience which it purports to describe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second sight requires control.</div>

<p>It is true that memory sometimes, as in a vision, seems to raise the
curtain upon the past and restore it to us in its pristine reality. We
may imagine at such moments experience can never really perish, but,
though hidden by chance from the roving eye, endures eternally in some
spiritual sphere. Such bodily recovery of the past, however, like other
telepathic visions, can never prove its own truth. A lapse into by-gone
perception, a sense of living the past over with all its vivid minuti&aelig;
and trivial concomitants, might involve no true repetition of anything
that had previously existed. It might be a fresh experience altogether.
The sense of knowing constitutes only a working presumption for
experiment to start with; until corroboration comes that presumption can
claim no respect from the outsider.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41" />Nature the theme common to various memories.</div>

<p>While memory remains a private presumption, therefore, it can be
compared with nothing else that might test its veracity. Only when
memory is expressed and, in the common field of expression, finds itself
corroborated by another memory, does it rise somewhat in dignity and
approach scientific knowledge. Two presumptions, when they coincide,
make a double assurance. While memory, then, is the basis of all
historical knowledge, it is not called history until it enters a field
where it can be supported or corrected by evidence. This field is that
natural world which all experiences, in so far as they are rational,
envisage together. Assertions relating to events in that world can
corroborate or contradict one another&mdash;something that would be
impossible if each memory, like the plot of a novel, moved in a sphere
of its own. For memory to meet memory, the two must present objects
which are similar or continuous: then they can corroborate or correct
each other and help to fix the order of events as they really
happened&mdash;that is, as they happened independently of what either memory
may chance to represent. Thus even the most miraculous and direct
recovery of the past needs corroboration if it is to be systematically
credited; but to receive corroboration it must refer to some event in
nature, in that common world in space and time to which other memories
and perceptions may refer also. In <a name="Page_42" id="Page_42" />becoming history, therefore, memory
becomes a portion of natural science. Its assertions are such that any
natural science may conceivably support or contradict them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Growth of legend.</div>

<p>Nature and its transformations, however, form too serried and
complicated a system for our wayward minds to dominate if left to their
spontaneous workings. Whatever is remembered or conceived is at first
vaguely believed to have its place in the natural order, all myth and
fable being originally localised within the confines of the material
world and made to pass for a part of early history. The method by which
knowledge of the past is preserved is so subject to imaginative
influence that it cannot avail to exclude from history anything that the
imagination may supply. In the growth of legend a dramatic rhythm
becomes more and more marked. What falls in with this rhythm is
reproduced and accentuated whenever the train of memory is started anew.
The absence of such cadences would leave a sensible gap&mdash;a gap which the
momentum of ideation is quick to fill up with some appropriate image.
Whatever, on the other hand, cannot be incorporated into the dominant
round of fancies is consigned more and more to oblivion.</p>

<p>This consolidation of legend is not intentional. It is ingenuous and for
the most part inevitable. When we muse about our own past we are
conscious of no effort to give it dramatic unity; on <a name="Page_43" id="Page_43" />the contrary, the
excitement and interest of the process consist in seeming to discover
the hidden eloquence and meaning of the events themselves. When a man of
experience narrates the wonders he has seen, we listen with a certain
awe, and believe in him for his miracles as we believe in our own memory
for its arts. A bard's mechanical and ritualistic habits usually put all
judgment on his own part to sleep; while the sanctity attributed to the
tale, as it becomes automatically more impressive, precludes tinkering
with it intentionally. Especially the allegories and marvels with which
early history is adorned are not ordinarily invented with malice
prepense. They are rather discovered in the mind, like a foundling,
between night and morning. They are divinely vouchsafed. Each time the
tale is retold it suffers a variation which is not challenged, since it
is memory itself that has varied. The change is discoverable only if
some record of the narrative in its former guise, or some physical
memorial of the event related, survives to be confronted with the
modified version. The modified version itself can make no comparisons.
It merely inherits the name and authority of its ancestor. The innocent
poet believes his own lies.</p>

<p>Legends consequently acquire a considerable eloquence and dramatic
force. These beauties accrue spontaneously, because rhythm and ideal
pertinence, in which poetic merit largely lies, <a name="Page_44" id="Page_44" />are natural formative
principles for speech and memory. As symmetry in material structures is
a ground for strength, and hills by erosion are worn to pyramids, so it
is in thoughts. Yet the stability attained is not absolute, but only
such stability as the circumstances require. Dramatic effect is not
everywhere achieved, nor is it missed by the narrator where it is
wanting, so that even the oldest and best-pruned legends are full of
irrelevant survivals, contradictions, and scraps of nonsense. These
literary blemishes are like embedded fossils and tell of facts which the
mechanism of reproduction, for some casual reason, has not obliterated.
The recorder of verbal tradition religiously sets down its
inconsistencies and leaves in the transfigured chronicle many tell-tale
incidents and remarks which, like atrophied organs in an animal body,
reveal its gradual formation. Art and a deliberate pursuit of unction or
beauty would have thrown over this baggage. The automatic and pious
minstrel carries it with him to the end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No history without documents.</div>

<p>For these reasons there can be no serious history until there are
archives and preserved records, although sometimes a man in a privileged
position may compose interesting essays on the events and persons of his
own time, as his personal experience has presented them to him. Archives
and records, moreover, do not absolve a speculative historian from
paying the same toll to the <a name="Page_45" id="Page_45" />dramatic unities and making the same
concessions to the laws of perspective which, in the absence of
documents, turn tradition so soon into epic poetry. The principle that
elicits histories out of records is the same that breeds legends out of
remembered events. In both cases the facts are automatically
foreshortened and made to cluster, as it were providentially, about a
chosen interest. The historian's politics, philosophy, or romantic
imagination furnishes a vital nucleus for reflection. All that falls
within that particular vortex is included in the mental picture, the
rest is passed over and tends to drop out of sight. It is not possible
to say, nor to think, everything at once; and the private interest which
guides a man in selecting his materials imposes itself inevitably on the
events he relates and especially on their grouping and significance.</p>

<p>History is always written wrong, and so always needs to be rewritten.
The conditions of expression and even of memory dragoon the facts and
put a false front on diffuse experience. What is interesting is brought
forward as if it had been central and efficacious in the march of
events, and harmonies are turned into causes. Kings and generals are
endowed with motives appropriate to what the historian values in their
actions; plans are imputed to them prophetic of their actual
achievements, while the thoughts that really preoccupied them remain
buried in <a name="Page_46" id="Page_46" />absolute oblivion. Such falsification is inevitable, and an
honest historian is guilty of it only against his will. He would wish,
as he loves the truth, to see and to render it entire. But the limits of
his book and of his knowledge force him to be partial. It is only a very
great mind, seasoned by large wisdom, that can lend such an accent and
such a carrying-power to a few facts as to make them representative of
all reality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The aim is truth.</div>

<p>Some historians, indeed, are so frankly partisan or cynical that they
avowedly write history with a view to effect, either political or
literary. Moralising historians belong to this school, as well as those
philosophers who worship evolution. They sketch every situation with
malice and twist it, as if it were an argument, to bring out a point,
much as fashionable portrait-painters sometimes surcharge the
characteristic, in order to make a bold effect at a minimum expense of
time and devotion. And yet the truly memorable aspect of a man is that
which he wears in the sunlight of common day, with all his generic
humanity upon him. His most interesting phase is not that which he might
assume under the lime-light of satirical or literary comparisons. The
characteristic is after all the inessential. It marks a peripheral
variation in the honest and sturdy lump. To catch only the heartless
shimmer of individuality is to paint a costume without the body that
supports it. Therefore a broad and noble historian sets down <a name="Page_47" id="Page_47" />all within
his apperception. His literary interests are forgotten; he is wholly
devoted to expressing the passions of the dead. His ideal, emanating
from his function and chosen for no extraneous reason, is to make his
heroes think and act as they really thought and acted in the world.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the opposite happens, sometimes to a marked and even
scandalous degree. As legend becomes in a few generations preposterous
myth, so history, after a few rehandlings and condensations, becomes
unblushing theory. Now theory&mdash;when we use the word for a schema of
things' relations and not for contemplation of them in their detail and
fulness&mdash;is an expedient to cover ignorance and remedy confusion. The
function of history, if it could be thoroughly fulfilled, would be to
render theory unnecessary. Did we possess a record of all geological
changes since the creation we should need no geological theory to
suggest to us what those changes must have been. Hypothesis is like the
rule of three: it comes into play only when one of the terms is unknown
and needs to be inferred from those which are given. The ideal
historian, since he would know all the facts, would need no hypotheses,
and since he would imagine and hold all events together in their actual
juxtapositions he would need no classifications. The intentions, acts,
and antecedents of every mortal would be seen in their precise places,
with no imputed <a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" />qualities or scope; and when those intentions had been
in fact fulfilled, the fulfilments too would occupy their modest
position in the rank and file of marching existence. To omniscience the
idea of cause and effect would be unthinkable. If all things were
perceived together and co-existed for thought, as they actually flow
through being, on one flat phenomenal level, what sense would there be
in saying that one element had compelled another to appear? The relation
of cause is an instrument necessary to thought only when thought is
guided by presumption. We say, &quot;If this thing had happened, that other
thing would have followed&quot;&mdash;a hypothesis which would lapse and become
unmeaning had we always known all the facts. For no supposition contrary
to fact would then have entered discourse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indirect methods of attaining it.</div>

<p>This ideal of direct omniscience is, however, impossible to attain; not
merely accidental frailties, but the very nature of things stands in the
way. Experience cannot be suspended or sustained in being, because its
very nucleus is mobile and in shifting cannot retain its past phases
bodily, but only at best some trace or representation of them. Memory
itself is an expedient by which what is hopelessly lost in its totality
may at least be partly kept in its beauty or significance; and
experience can be enlarged in no other way than by carrying into the
moving present the lesson <a name="Page_49" id="Page_49" />and transmitted habit of much that is past.
History is naturally reduced to similar indirect methods of recovering
what has lapsed. The historian's object may be to bring the past again
before the mind in all its living reality, but in pursuing that object
he is obliged to appeal to inference, to generalisation, and to dramatic
fancy. We may conveniently distinguish in history, as it is perforce
written by men, three distinct elements, which we may call historical
investigation, historical theory, and historical romance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Historical research a part of physics.</div>

<p>Historical investigation is the natural science of the past. The
circumstance that its documents are usually literary may somewhat
disguise the physical character and the physical principles of this
science; but when a man wishes to discover what really happened at a
given moment, even if the event were somebody's thought; he has to read
his sources, not for what they say, but for what they imply. In other
words, the witnesses cannot be allowed merely to speak for themselves,
after the gossiping fashion familiar in Herodotus; their testimony has
to be interpreted according to the laws of evidence. The past needs to
be reconstructed out of reports, as in geology or arch&aelig;ology it needs to
be reconstructed out of stratifications and ruins. A man's memory or the
report in a newspaper is a fact justifying certain inferences about its
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" />probable causes according to laws which such phenomena betray in the
present when they are closely scrutinised. This reconstruction is often
very difficult, and sometimes all that can be established in the end is
merely that the tradition before us is certainly false; somewhat as a
perplexed geologist might venture on no conclusion except that the state
of the earth's crust was once very different from what it is now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Verification here indirect.</div>

<p>A natural science dealing with the past labours under the disadvantage
of not being able to appeal to experiment. The facts it terminates upon
cannot be recovered, so that they may verify in sense the hypothesis
that had inferred them. The hypothesis can be tested only by current
events; it is then turned back upon the past, to give assurance of facts
which themselves are hypothetical and remain hanging, as it were, to the
loose end of the hypothesis itself. A hypothetical fact is a most
dangerous creature, since it lives on the credit of a theory which in
turn would be bankrupt if the fact should fail. Inferred past facts are
more deceptive than facts prophesied, because while the risk of error in
the inference is the same, there is no possibility of discovering that
error; and the historian, while really as speculative as the prophet,
can never be found out.</p>

<p>Most facts known to man, however, are reached by inference, and their
reality may be wisely assumed so long as the principle by which <a name="Page_51" id="Page_51" />they
are inferred, when it is applied in the present, finds complete and
constant verification. Presumptions involved in memory and tradition
give the first hypothetical facts we count upon; the relations which
these first facts betray supply the laws by which facts are to be
concatenated; and these laws may then be used to pass from the first
hypothetical facts to hypothetical facts of a second order, forming a
background and congruous extension to those originally assumed. This
expansion of discursive science can go on for ever, unless indeed the
principles of inference employed in it involve some present existence,
such as a skeleton in a given tomb, which direct experience fails to
verify. Then the theory itself is disproved and the whole galaxy of
hypothetical facts which clustered about it forfeit their credibility.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Futile ideal to survey all facts.</div>

<p>Historical investigation has for its aim to fix the order and character
of events throughout past time in all places. The task is frankly
superhuman, because no block of real existence, with its infinitesimal
detail, can be recorded, nor if somehow recorded could it be dominated
by the mind; and to carry on a survey of this social continuum <i>ad
infinitum</i> would multiply the difficulty. The task might also be called
infrahuman, because the sort of omniscience which such complete
historical science would achieve would merely furnish materials for
intelligence: it would be inferior to intel<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52" />ligence itself. There are
many things which, as Aristotle says, it is better not to know than to
know&mdash;namely, those things which do not count in controlling the mind's
fortunes nor enter into its ideal expression. Such is the whole flux of
immediate experience in other minds or in one's own past; and just as it
is better to forget than to remember a nightmare or the by-gone
sensations of sea-sickness, so it is better not to conceive the sensuous
pulp of alien experience, something infinite in amount and insignificant
in character.</p>

<p>An attempt to rehearse the inner life of everybody that has ever lived
would be no rational endeavour. Instead of lifting the historian above
the world and making him the most consummate of creatures, it would
flatten his mind out into a passive after-image of diffuse existence,
with all its horrible blindness, strain, and monotony. Reason is not
come to repeat the universe but to fulfil it. Besides, a complete survey
of events would perforce register all changes that have taken place in
matter since time began, the fields of geology, astronomy, pal&aelig;ontology,
and arch&aelig;ology being all, in a sense, included in history. Such learning
would dissolve thought in a vertigo, if it had not already perished of
boredom. Historical research is accordingly a servile science which may
enter the Life of Reason to perform there some incidental service, but
which ought to lapse as soon as that service is performed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Historical theory.</div>

<p>The profit of studying history lies in some<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" />thing else than in a dead
knowledge of what happens to have happened. A seductive alternative
might be to say that the profit of it lies in <i>understanding</i> what has
happened, in perceiving the principles and laws that govern social
evolution, or the meaning which events have. We are hereby launched upon
a region of physico-ethical speculation where any man with a genius for
quick generalisation can swim at ease. To find the one great cause why
Borne fell, especially if no one has ever thought of it before, or to
expound the true import of the French Revolution, or to formulate in
limpid sentences the essence of Greek culture&mdash;what could be more
tempting or more purely literary? It would ill become the author of this
book to decry allegorical expressions, or a cavalierlike fashion of
dismissing whole periods and tendencies with a verbal antithesis. We
must have exercises in apperception, a work of imagination must be taken
imaginatively, and a landscape painter must be suffered to be, at his
own risk, as impressionistic as he will. If Raphael, when he was
designing the <i>School of Athens</i>, had said to himself that Aristotle
should point down to a fact and Plato up to a meaning, or when designing
the <i>Disputa</i> had conceived that the proudest of intellects, weary of
argument and learning, should throw down his books and turn to
revelation for guidance, there would have been much historical
pertinence in those conceptions; yet the figures would <a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" />have been
allegorical, contracting into a decorative design events that had been
dispersed through centuries and emotions that had only cropped up here
and there, with all manner of variations and alloys, when the particular
natural situation had made them inevitable. So the Renaissance might be
spoken of as a person and the Reformation as her step-sister, and
something might be added about the troubles of their home life; but
would it be needful in that case to enter a warning that these units
were verbal merely, and that the phenomena and the forces really at work
had been multitudinous and infinitesimal?</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is arbitrary.</div>

<p>In fine, historical terms mark merely rhetorical unities, which have no
dynamic cohesion, and there are no historical laws which are not at
bottom physical, like the laws of habit&mdash;those expressions of Newton's
first law of motion. An essayist may play with historical apperception
as long as he will and always find something new to say, discovering the
ideal nerve and issue of a movement in a different aspect of the facts.
The truly proportionate, constant, efficacious relations between things
will remain material. Physical causes traverse the moral units at which
history stops, determining their force and duration, and the order, so
irrelevant to intent, in which they succeed one another. Even the single
man's life and character have subterranean sources; how should the outer
expression and influence of that character have sources <a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" />more
superficial than its own? Yet we cannot trace mechanical necessity down
to the more stable units composing a personal mechanism, and much less,
therefore, to those composing a complex social evolution. We accordingly
translate the necessity, obviously lurking under life's commonplace yet
unaccountable shocks, into verbal principles, names for general
impressive results, that play some r&ocirc;le in our ideal philosophy. Each of
these idols of the theatre is visible only on a single stage and to duly
predisposed spectators. The next passion affected will throw a
differently coloured calcium light on the same pageant, and there will
be no end of rival evolutions and incompatible ideal principles crossing
one another at every interesting event.</p>

<p>Such a manipulation of history, when made by persons who underestimate
their imaginative powers, ends in asserting that events have directed
themselves prophetically upon the interests which they arouse. Apart
from the magic involved and the mockery of all science, there is a
difficulty here which even a dramatic idealist ought to feel. The
interests affected are themselves many and contrary. If history is to be
understood teleologically, which of all the possible ends it might be
pursuing shall we think really endowed with regressive influence and
responsible for the movement that is going to realise it? Did Columbus,
for instance, discover America so that George Washington might exist and
that some day foot<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56" />ball and the Church of England may prevail throughout
the world? Or was it (as has been seriously maintained) in order that
the converted Indians of South America might console Saint Peter for the
defection of the British and Germans? Or was America, as Hegel believed,
ideally superfluous, the absolute having become self-conscious enough
already in Prussia? Or shall we say that the real goal is at an infinite
distance and unimaginable by us, and useless, therefore, for
understanding anything?</p>

<p>In truth, whatever plausibility the providential view of a given
occurrence may have is dependent on the curious limitation and
selfishness of the observer's estimations. Sheep are providentially
designed for men; but why not also for wolves, and men for worms and
microbes? If the historian is willing to accept such a suggestion, and
to become a blind worshipper of success, applauding every issue, however
lamentable for humanity, and calling it admirable tragedy, he may seem
for a while to save his theory by making it mystical; yet presently this
last illusion will be dissipated when he loses his way in the maze and
finds that all victors perish in their turn and everything, if you look
far enough, falls back into the inexorable vortex. This is the sort of
observation that the Indian sages made long ago; it is what renders
their philosophy, for all its practical impotence, such an irrefragable
record of experience, such a superior, definitive perception of <a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" />the
flux. Beside it, our progresses of two centuries and our philosophies of
history, embracing one-quarter of the earth for three thousand years,
seem puerile vistas indeed. Shall all eternity and all existence be for
the sake of what is happening here to-day, and to me? Shall we strive
manfully to the top of this particular wave, on the ground that its foam
is the culmination of all things for ever?</p>

<p>There is a sense, of course, in which definite political plans and moral
aspirations may well be fulfilled by events. Our ancestors, sharing and
anticipating our natures, may have had in many respects our actual
interests in view, as we may have those of posterity. Such ideal
co-operation extends far, where primary interests are concerned; it is
rarer and more qualified where a fine and fragile organisation is
required to support the common spiritual life. Even in these cases, the
aim pursued and attained is not the force that operates, since the
result achieved had many other conditions besides the worker's intent,
and that intent itself had causes which it knew nothing of. Every
&quot;historical force&quot; pompously appealed to breaks up on inspection into a
cataract of miscellaneous natural processes and minute particular
causes. It breaks into its mechanical constituents and proves to have
been nothing but an <i>effet d'ensemble</i> produced on a mind whose habits
and categories are essentially rhetorical.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A moral critique of the past is possible.</div>

<p>This sort of false history or philosophy of his<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" />tory might be purified,
like so many other things, by self-knowledge. If the philosopher in
reviewing events confessed that he was scrutinising them in order to
abstract from them whatever tended to illustrate his own ideals, as he
might look over a crowd to find his friends, the operation would become
a perfectly legitimate one. The events themselves would be left for
scientific inference to discover, where credible reports did not testify
to them directly; and the causes of events would be left to some theory
of natural evolution, to be stated, according to the degree of knowledge
attained, in terms more and more exact and mechanical. In the presence
of the past so defined imagination and will, however, would not abdicate
their rights, and a sort of retrospective politics, an estimate of
events in reference to the moral ideal which they embodied or betrayed,
might supervene upon positive history. This estimate of evolution might
well be called a philosophy of history, since it would be a higher
operation performed on the results of natural science, to give a needful
basis and illustration to the ideal. The present work is an essay in
that direction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How it might be just.</div>

<p>The ideal which in such a review would serve as the touchstone for
estimation, if it were an enlightened ideal, would recognise its own
natural basis, and therefore would also recognise that under other
conditions <a name="Page_59" id="Page_59" />other ideals, no less legitimate, may have arisen and may
have been made the standard for a different judgment on the world.
Historical investigation, were its resources adequate, would reveal to
us what these various ideals have been. Every animal has his own, and
whenever individuals or nations have become reflective they have known
how to give articulate expression to theirs. That all these ideals could
not have been realised in turn or together is an immense misfortune, the
irremediable half-tragedy of life, by which we also suffer. In
estimating the measure of success achieved anywhere a liberal historian,
who does not wish to be bluntly irrational, will of course estimate it
from <i>all</i> these points of view, considering all real interests
affected, in so far as he can appreciate them. This is what is meant by
putting the standard of value, not in some arbitrary personal dogma but
in a variegated omnipresent happiness.</p>

<p>It is by no means requisite, therefore, in disentangling the Life of
Reason, to foresee what ultimate form the good might some day take, much
less to make the purposes of the philosopher himself, his time, or his
nation the test of all excellence. This test is the perpetual
concomitant ideal of the life it is applied to. As all could not be well
in the world if my own purposes were defeated, so the general excellence
of things would be heightened if other men's purposes also had been
fulfilled. Each will is a true centre for universal <a name="Page_60" id="Page_60" />estimation. As each
will, therefore, comes to expression, real and irreversible values are
introduced into the world, and the historian, in estimating what has
been hitherto achieved, needs to make himself the spokesman for all past
aspirations.</p>

<p>If the Egyptian poets sang well, though that conduces not at all to our
advantage, and though all those songs are now dumb, the Life of Reason
was thereby increased once for all in pith and volume. Brief erratic
experiments made in living, if they were somewhat successful in their
day, remain successes always: and this is the only kind of success that
in the end can be achieved at all. The philosopher that looks for what
is good in history and measures the past by the scale of reason need be
no impertinent dogmatist on that account. Reason would not be reason but
passion if it did not make all passions in all creatures constituents of
its own authority. The judgments it passes on existence are only the
judgments which existence, so far, has passed on itself, and these are
indelible and have their proportionate weight though others of many
different types may surround or succeed them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transition to historical romance.</div>

<p>To inquire what everybody has thought about the world, and into what
strange shapes every passionate dream would fain have transformed
existence, might be merely a part of historical investigation. These
facts of preference and estimation might be made to stand side by side
with all <a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" />other facts in that absolute physical order which the universe
must somehow possess. In the reference book of science they would all
find their page and line. But it is not for the sake of making vain
knowledge complete that historians are apt to linger over heroic
episodes and commanding characters in the world's annals. It is not even
in the hope of discovering just to what extent and in how many
directions experience has been a tragedy. The mathematical balance of
failure and success, even if it could be drawn with accuracy, would not
be a truth of moral importance, since whatever that balance might be for
the world at large, success and benefit here, from the living point of
view, would be equally valid and delightful; and however good or however
bad the universe may be it is always worth while to make it better.</p>

<p>What engages the historian in the reconstruction of moral life, such as
the past contained, is that he finds in that life many an illustration
of his own ideals, or even a necessary stimulus in defining what his
ideals are. Where his admiration and his sympathy are awakened, he sees
noble aims and great achievements, worthy of being minutely studied and
brought vividly before later generations. Very probably he will be led
by moral affinities with certain phases of the past to attribute to
those phases, in their abstraction and by virtue of their moral dignity,
a material effi<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" />cacy which they did not really have; and his interest in
history's moral will make him turn history itself into a fable. This
abuse may be abated, however, by having recourse to impartial historical
investigation, that will restore to the hero all his circumstantial
impotence, and to the glorious event all its insignificant causes.
Certain men and certain episodes will retain, notwithstanding, their
intrinsic nobility; and the historian, who is often a politician and a
poet rather than a man of science, will dwell on those noble things so
as to quicken his own sense for greatness and to burnish in his soul
ideals that may have remained obscure for want of scrutiny or may have
been tarnished by too much contact with a sordid world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Possibility of genuine epics.</div>

<p>History so conceived has the function of epic or dramatic poetry. The
moral life represented may actually have been lived through; but that
circumstance is incidental merely and what makes the story worth telling
is its pertinence to the political or emotional life of the present. To
revive past moral experience is indeed wellnigh impossible unless the
living will can still covet or dread the same issues; historical romance
cannot be truthful or interesting when profound changes have taken place
in human nature. The reported acts and sentiments of early peoples lose
their tragic dignity in our eyes when they lose their pertinence to our
own aims. So that a recital of history with an eye to its <a name="Page_63" id="Page_63" />dramatic
values is possible only when that history is, so to speak, our own, or
when we assimilate it to ours by poetic license.</p>

<p>The various functions of history have been generally carried on
simultaneously and with little consciousness of their profound
diversity. Since historical criticism made its appearance, the romantic
interest in the past, far from abating, has fed eagerly on all the
material incidents and private gossip of remote times. This sort of
petty historical drama has reflected contemporary interests, which have
centred so largely in material possessions and personal careers; while
at the same time it has kept pace with the knowledge of minuti&aelig; attained
by arch&aelig;ology. When historical investigation has reached its limits a
period of ideal reconstruction may very likely set in. Indeed were it
possible to collect in archives exhaustive accounts of everything that
has ever happened, so that the curious man might always be informed on
any point of fact that interested him, historical imagination might grow
free again in its movements. Not being suspected of wishing to distort
facts which could so easily be pointed to, it might become more
conscious of its own moral function, and it might turn unblushingly to
what was important and inspiring in order to put it with dramatic force
before the mind. Such a treatment of history would reinstate that epic
and tragic poetry which has become obsolete; it might well be written in
verse, and <a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" />would at any rate be frankly imaginative; it might furnish a
sort of ritual, with scientific and political sanctions, for public
feasts. Tragedies and epics are such only in name if they do not deal
with the highest interests and destinies of a people; and they could
hardly deal with such ideals in an authoritative and definite way,
unless they found them illustrated in that people's traditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Literal truth abandoned.</div>

<p>Historic romance is a work of art, not of science, and its fidelity to
past fact is only an expedient, often an excellent and easy one, for
striking the key-note of present ideals. The insight attained, even when
it is true insight into what some one else felt in some other age, draws
its force and sublimity from current passions, passions potential in the
auditor's soul. Mary Queen of Scots, for instance, doubtless repeated,
in many a fancied dialogue with Queen Elizabeth, the very words that
Schiller puts into her mouth in the central scene of his play, &quot;<i>Denn
ich bin Euer K&ouml;nig!</i>&quot; Yet the dramatic force of that expression, its
audacious substitution of ideals for facts, depends entirely on the
scope which we lend it. Different actors and different readers would
interpret it differently. Some might see in it nothing but a sally in a
woman's quarrel, reading it with the accent of mere spite and
irritation. Then the tragedy, not perhaps without historic truth, would
be reduced to a loud comedy. Other interpreters might find in the
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65" />phrase the whole feudal system, all the chivalry, legality, and
foolishness of the Middle Ages. Then the drama would become more
interesting, and the poor queen's cry, while that of a mind
sophisticated and fanatical, would have great pathos and keenness. To
reach sublimity, however, that moment would have to epitomise ideals
which we deeply respected. We should have to believe in the sanctity of
canon law and in the divine right of primogeniture. That a woman may
have been very unhappy or that a state may have been held together by
personal allegiance does not raise the fate of either to the tragic
plane, unless &quot;laws that are not of to-day nor yesterday,&quot; aspirations
native to the heart, shine through those legendary misfortunes.</p>

<p>It would matter nothing to the excellence of Schiller's drama which of
these interpretations might have been made by Mary Stuart herself at any
given moment; doubtless her attitude toward her rival was coloured on
different occasions by varying degrees of political insight and moral
fervour. The successful historical poet would be he who caught the most
significant attitude which a person in that position could possibly have
assumed, and his Mary Stuart, whether accidentally resembling the real
woman or not, would be essentially a mythical person. So Electra and
Antigone and Helen of Troy are tragic figures absolved from historical
accuracy, although possibly if the personages of heroic times were known
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" />to us we might find that our highest imagination had been anticipated
in their consciousness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">History exists to be transcended.</div>

<p>Of the three parts into which the pursuit of history may be
divided&mdash;investigation, theory, and story-telling&mdash;not one attains ideal
finality. Investigation is merely useful, because its intrinsic
ideal&mdash;to know every detail of everything&mdash;is not rational, and its
acceptable function can only be to offer accurate information upon such
points as are worth knowing for some ulterior reason. Historical theory,
in turn, is a falsification of causes, since no causes are other than
mechanical; it is an arbitrary foreshortening of physics, and it
dissolves in the presence either of adequate knowledge or of clear
ideals. Finally, historical romance passes, as it grows mature, into
epics and tragedies, where the moral imagination disengages itself from
all allegiance to particular past facts. Thus history proves to be an
imperfect field for the exercise of reason; it is a provisional
discipline; its values, with the mind's progress, would empty into
higher activities. The function of history is to lend materials to
politics and to poetry. These arts need to dominate past events, the
better to dominate the present situation and the ideal one. A good book
of history is one that helps the statesman to formulate and to carry out
his plans, or that helps the tragic poet to conceive what is most
glorious in human destiny. Such a book, as knowledge and ignorance are
now mingled, will <a name="Page_67" id="Page_67" />have to borrow something from each of the methods by
which history is commonly pursued. Investigation will be necessary,
since the needful facts are not all indubitably known; theory will be
necessary too, so that those facts may be conceived in their pertinence
to public interests, and the latter may thereby be clarified; and
romance will not be wholly excluded, because the various activities of
the mind about the same matter cannot be divided altogether, and a
dramatic treatment is often useful in summarising a situation, when all
the elements of it cannot be summoned up in detail before the mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its great r&ocirc;le.</div>

<p>Fragmentary, arbitrary, and insecure as historical conceptions must
remain, they are nevertheless highly important. In human consciousness
the indispensable is in inverse ratio to the demonstrable. Sense is the
foundation of everything. Without sense memory would be both false and
useless. Yet memory rather than sense is knowledge in the pregnant
acceptation of the word; for in sense object and process are hardly
distinguished, whereas in memory significance inheres in the datum, and
the present vouches for the absent. Similarly history, which is derived
from memory, is superior to it; for while it merely extends memory
artificially it shows a higher logical development than memory has and
is riper for ideal uses. Trivial and useless matter has dropped out.
Inference has gone a step farther, thought is more largely
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68" />representative, and testimony conveyed by the reports of others or
found in monuments leads the speculative mind to infer events that must
have filled the remotest ages. This information is not passive or idle
knowledge; it truly <i>informs</i> or shapes the mind, giving it new
aptitudes. As an efficacious memory modifies instinct, by levelling it
with a wider survey of the situation, so a memory of what human
experience has been, a sense of what it is likely to be under specific
circumstances, gives the will a new basis. What politics or any large
drama deals with is a will cast into historic moulds, an imagination
busy with what we call great interests. Great interests are a gift which
history makes to the heart. A barbarian is no less subject to the past
than is the civic man who knows what his past is and means to be loyal
to it; but the barbarian, for want of a trans-personal memory, crawls
among superstitions which he cannot understand or revoke and among
persons whom he may hate or love, but whom he can never think of raising
to a higher plane, to the level of a purer happiness. The whole dignity
of human endeavour is thus bound up with historic issues; and as
conscience needs to be controlled by experience if it is to become
rational, so personal experience itself needs to be enlarged ideally if
the failures and successes it reports are to touch impersonal interests.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>MECHANISM</p>


<div class="sidenote">Recurrent forms in nature.</div>

<p>A retrospect over human experience, if a little extended, can hardly
fail to come upon many interesting recurrences. The seasons make their
round and the generations of men, like the forest leaves, repeat their
career. In this its finer texture history undoubtedly repeats itself. A
study of it, in registering so many recurrences, leads to a description
of habit, or to natural history. To observe a recurrence is to divine a
mechanism. It is to analyse a phenomenon, distinguishing its form, which
alone recurs, from its existence, which is irrevocable; and that the
flux of phenomena should turn out, on closer inspection, to be composed
of a multitude of recurring forms, regularly interwoven, is the ideal of
mechanism. The forms, taken ideally and in themselves, are what
reflection first rescues from the flux and makes a science of; they
constitute that world of eternal relations with which dialectic is
conversant. To note here and there some passing illustration of these
forms is one way of studying experience. The observer, the poet, the
historian merely <i>define</i> <a name="Page_70" id="Page_70" />what they see. But these incidental
illustrations of form (called by Plato phenomena) may have a method in
their comings and goings, and this method may in turn be definable. It
will be a new sort of constant illustrated in the flux; and this we call
a law. If events could be reduced to a number of constant forms moving
in a constant medium according to a constant law, a maximum of constancy
would be introduced into the flux, which would thereby be proved to be
mechanical.</p>

<p>The form of events, abstracted from their material presence, becomes a
general mould to which we tend to assimilate new observations. Whatever
in particular instances may contravene the accredited rule, we attribute
without a qualm to unknown variations in the circumstances, thus saving
our faith in order at all hazards and appealing to investigation to
justify the same. Only when another rule suggests itself which leaves a
smaller margin unaccounted for in the phenomena do we give up our first
generalisation. Not even the rudest superstition can be criticised or
dislodged scientifically save by another general rule, more exact and
trustworthy than the superstition. The scepticism which comes from
distrust of abstraction and disgust with reckoning of any sort is not a
scientific force; it is an intellectual weakness.</p>

<p>Generalities are indeed essential to understanding, which is apt to
impose them hastily upon particulars. Confirmation is not needed to
create <a name="Page_71" id="Page_71" />prejudice. It suffices that a vivid impression should once have
cut its way into the mind and settled there in a fertile soil; it will
entwine itself at once with its chance neighbours and these adventitious
relations will pass henceforth for a part of the fact. Repetition,
however, is a good means of making or keeping impressions vivid and
almost the only means of keeping them unchanged. Prejudices, however
refractory to new evidence, evolve inwardly of themselves. The mental
soil in which they lie is in a continual ferment and their very vitality
will extend their scope and change their application. Generalisations,
therefore, when based on a single instance, will soon forget it and
shift their ground, as unchecked words shift their meaning. But when a
phenomenon actually recurs the generalisations founded on it are
reinforced and kept identical, and prejudices so sustained by events
make man's knowledge of nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their discovery makes the flux calculable.</div>

<p>Natural science consists of general ideas which look for verification in
events, and which find it. The particular instance, once noted, is
thrown aside like a squeezed orange, its significance in establishing
some law having once been extracted. Science, by this flight into the
general, lends immediate experience an interest and scope which its
parts, taken blindly, could never possess; since if we remained sunk in
the moments of existence and never abstracted their character from their
pres<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72" />ence, we should never know that they had any relation to one
another. We should feel their incubus without being able to distinguish
their dignities or to give them names. By analysing what we find and
abstracting what recurs from its many vain incidents we can discover a
sustained structure within, which enables us to foretell what we may
find in future. Science thus articulates experience and reveals its
skeleton.</p>

<p>Skeletons are not things particularly congenial to poets, unless it be
for the sake of having something truly horrible to shudder at and to
frighten children with: and so a certain school of philosophers exhaust
their rhetoric in convincing us that the objects known to science are
artificial and dead, while the living reality is infinitely rich and
absolutely unutterable. This is merely an ungracious way of describing
the office of thought and bearing witness to its necessity. A body is
none the worse for having some bones in it, even if they are not all
visible on the surface. They are certainly not the whole man, who
nevertheless runs and leaps by their leverage and smooth turning in
their sockets; and a surgeon's studies in dead anatomy help him
excellently to set a living joint. The abstractions of science are
extractions of truths. Truths cannot of themselves constitute existence
with its irrational concentration in time, place, and person, its
hopeless flux, and its vital exuberance; but they can be true of
existence; they can disclose that structure by which its parts <a name="Page_73" id="Page_73" />cohere
materially and become ideally inferable from one another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Looser principles tried first.</div>

<p>Science becomes demonstrable in proportion as it becomes abstract. It
becomes in the same measure applicable and useful, as mathematics
witnesses, whenever the abstraction is judiciously made and has seized
the profounder structural features in the phenomenon. These features are
often hard for human eyes to discern, buried as they may be in the
internal infinitesimal texture of things. Things accordingly seem to
move on the world's stage in an unaccountable fashion, and to betray
magic affinities to what is separated from them by apparent chasms. The
types of relation which the mind may observe are multifarious. Any
chance conjunction, any incidental harmony, will start a hypothesis
about the nature of the universe and be the parent image of a whole
system of philosophy. In self-indulgent minds most of these standard
images are dramatic, and the cue men follow in unravelling experience is
that offered by some success or failure of their own. The sanguine,
having once found a pearl in a dunghill, feel a glorious assurance that
the world's true secret is that everything in the end is ordered for
everybody's benefit&mdash;and that is optimism. The atrabilious, being ill at
ease with themselves, see the workings everywhere of insidious sin, and
conceive that the world is a dangerous place of trial. A somewhat more
observant intellect may decide that what exists is <a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" />a certain number of
definite natures, each striving to preserve and express itself; and in
such language we still commonly read political events and our friend's
actions. At the dawn of science a Thales, observing the ways and the
conditions of things somewhat more subtly, will notice that rain,
something quite adventitious to the fields, is what covers them with
verdure, that the slime breeds life, that a liquid will freeze to stone
and melt to air; and his shrewd conclusion will be that everything is
water in one disguise or another. It is only after long accumulated
observation that we can reach any exact law of nature; and this law we
hardly think of applying to living things. These have not yet revealed
the secret of their structure, and clear insight is vouchsafed us only
in such regions as that of mathematical physics, where cogency in the
ideal system is combined with adequacy to explain the phenomena.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mechanism for the most part hidden.</div>

<p>These exact sciences cover in the gross the field in which human life
appears, the antecedents of this life, and its instruments. To a
speculative mind, that had retained an ingenuous sense of nature's
inexhaustible resources and of man's essential continuity with other
natural things, there could be no ground for doubting that similar
principles (could they be traced in detail) would be seen to preside
over all man's action and passion. A thousand indications, drawn from
introspection and from history, would be found to confirm this
specula<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" />tive presumption. It is not only earthquakes and floods, summer
and winter, that bring human musings sharply to book. Love and ambition
are unmistakable blossomings of material forces, and the more intense
and poetical a man's sense is of his spiritual condition the more loudly
will he proclaim his utter dependence on nature and the identity of the
moving principle in him and in her.</p>

<p>Mankind and all its works are undeniably subject to gravity and to the
law of projectiles; yet what is true of these phenomena in bulk seems to
a superficial observation not to be true of them in detail, and a person
may imagine that he subverts all the laws of physics whenever he wags
his tongue. Only in inorganic matter is the ruling mechanism open to
human inspection: here changes may be seen to be proportionate to the
elements and situation in which they occur. Habit here seems perfectly
steady and is called necessity, since the observer is able to deduce it
unequivocally from given properties in the body and in the external
bodies acting upon it. In the parts of nature which we call living and
to which we impute consciousness, habit, though it be fatal enough, is
not so exactly measurable and perspicuous. Physics cannot account for
that minute motion and pullulation in the earth's crust of which human
affairs are a portion. Human affairs have to be surveyed under
categories lying closer to those employed in memory and legend. <a name="Page_76" id="Page_76" />These
looser categories are of every sort&mdash;grammatical, moral, magical&mdash;and
there is no knowing when any of them will apply or in what measure.
Between the matters covered by the exact sciences and vulgar experience
there remains, accordingly, a wide and nebulous gulf. Where we cannot
see the mechanism involved in what happens we have to be satisfied with
an empirical description of appearances as they first fall together in
our apprehension; and this want of understanding in the observer is what
popular philosophy calls intelligence in the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Yet presumably pervasive.</div>

<p>That this gulf is apparent only, being due to inadequacy and confusion
in human perception rather than to incoherence in things, is a
speculative conviction altogether trustworthy. Any one who can at all
catch the drift of experience&mdash;moral no less than physical&mdash;must feel
that mechanism rules the whole world. There are doubleness and diversity
enough in things to satiate the greatest lover of chaos; but that a
cosmos nevertheless underlies the superficial play of sense and opinion
is what all practical reason must assume and what all comprehended
experience bears witness to. A cosmos does not mean a disorder with
which somebody happens to be well pleased; it means a necessity from
which every one must draw his happiness. If a principle is efficacious
it is to that extent mechanical. For to be efficacious a principle must
apply necessarily and proportionately; it must assure us that where <a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" />the
factors are the same as on a previous occasion the quotient will be the
same also.</p>

<p>Now, in order that the flux of things should contain a repetition,
elements must be identified within it; these identical elements may then
find themselves in an identical situation, on which the same result may
ensue which ensued before. If the elements were not constant and
recognisable, or if their relations did not suffice to determine the
succeeding event, no observation could be transferred with safety from
the past to the future. Thus art and comprehension would be defeated
together. Novelties in the world are not lacking, because the elements
entering at any moment into a given combination have never before
entered into a combination exactly similar. Mechanism applies to the
matter and minute texture of things; but its applying there will create,
at each moment, fresh ideal wholes, formal unities which mind emanates
from and represents. The result will accordingly always be unprecedented
in the total impression it produces, in exact proportion to the
singularity of the situation in hand. Mechanical processes are not like
mathematical relations, because they <i>happen</i>. What they express the
form of is a flux, not a truth or an ideal necessity. The situation may
therefore always be new, though produced from the preceding situation by
rules which are invariable, since the preceding situation was itself
novel.</p>

<p>Mechanism might be called the dialectic of the <a name="Page_78" id="Page_78" />irrational. It is such a
measure of intelligibility as is compatible with flux and with
existence. Existence itself being irrational and change unintelligible,
the only necessity they are susceptible of is a natural or empirical
necessity, impinging at both ends upon brute matters of fact. The
existential elements, their situation, number, affinities, and mutual
influence all have to be begged before calculation can begin. When these
surds have been accepted at their face value, inference may set to work
among them; yet the inference that mechanism will continue to reign will
not amount to certain knowledge until the event inferred has come to
give it proof. Calculation in physics differs from pure dialectic in
that the ultimate object it looks to is not ideal. Theory here must
revert to the immediate flux for its sanction, whereas dialectic is a
centrifugal emanation from existence and never returns to its point of
origin. It remains suspended in the ether of those eternal relations
which forms have, even when found embedded in matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inadequacy of consciousness.</div>

<p>If the total flux is continuous and naturally intelligible, why is the
part felt by man so disjointed and opaque? An answer to this question
may perhaps be drawn from the fact that consciousness apparently arises
to express the functions only of extremely complicated organisms. The
basis of thought is vastly more elaborate than its deliverance. It takes
a wonderful brain and exquisite senses to produce a few <a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" />stupid ideas.
The mind starts, therefore, with a tremendous handicap. In order to
attain adequate practical knowledge it would have to represent clearly
its own conditions; for the purpose of mind is its own furtherance and
perfection, and before that purpose could be fulfilled the mind's
interests would have to become parallel to the body's fortunes. This
means that the body's actual relations in nature would have to become
the mind's favourite themes in discourse. Had this harmony been
attained, the more accurately and intensely thought was exercised the
more stable its status would become and the more prosperous its
undertakings, since lively thought would then be a symptom of health in
the body and of mechanical equilibrium with the environment.</p>

<p>The body's actual relations, however, on which health depends, are
infinitely complex and immensely extended. They sweep the whole material
universe and are intertwined most closely with all social and passionate
forces, with their incalculable mechanical springs. Meantime the mind
begins by being a feeble and inconsequent ghost. Its existence is
intermittent and its visions unmeaning. It fails to conceive its own
interests or the situations that might support or defeat those
interests. If it pictures anything clearly, it is only some phantastic
image which in no way represents its own complex basis. Thus the
parasitical human mind, finding what clear knowledge it has laughably
insufficient to inter<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" />pret its destiny, takes to neglecting knowledge
altogether and to hugging instead various irrational ideas. On the one
hand it lapses into dreams which, while obviously irrelevant to
practice, express the mind's vegetative instincts; hence art and
mythology, which substitute play-worlds for the real one on correlation
with which human prosperity and dignity depend. On the other hand, the
mind becomes wedded to conventional objects which mark, perhaps, the
turning-points of practical life and plot the curve of it in a schematic
and disjointed fashion, but which are themselves entirely opaque and, as
we say, material. Now as matter is commonly a name for things not
understood, men materially minded are those whose ideas, while
practical, are meagre and blind, so that their knowledge of nature, if
not invalid, is exceedingly fragmentary. This grossness in common sense,
like irrelevance in imagination, springs from the fact that the mind's
representative powers are out of focus with its controlling conditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its articulation inferior to that of its objects.</div>

<p>In other words, sense ought to correspond in articulation with the
object to be represented&mdash;otherwise the object's structure, with the
fate it imports; cannot be transferred into analogous ideas. Now the
human senses are not at all fitted to represent an organism on the scale
of the human body. They catch its idle gestures but not the inner
processes which control its action. The <a name="Page_81" id="Page_81" />senses are immeasurably too
gross. What to them is a <i>minimum visibile</i>, a just perceptible atom, is
in the body's structure, very likely, a system of worlds, the inner
cataclysms of which count in producing that so-called atom's behaviour
and endowing it with affinities apparently miraculous. What must the
seed of animals contain, for instance, to be the ground, as it
notoriously is, for every physical and moral property of the offspring?
Or what must the system of signals and the reproductive habit in a brain
be, for it to co-ordinate instinctive movements, learn tricks, and
remember? Our senses can represent at all adequately only such objects
as the solar system or a work of human architecture, where the unit's
inner structure and fermentation may be provisionally neglected in
mastering the total. The architect may reckon in bricks and the
astronomer in planets and yet foresee accurately enough the practical
result. In a word, only what is extraordinarily simple is intelligible
to man, while only what is extraordinarily complex can support
intelligence. Consciousness is essentially incompetent to understand
what most concerns it, its own vicissitudes, and sense is altogether out
of scale with the objects of practical interest in life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Science consequently retarded.</div>

<p>One consequence of this profound maladjustment is that science is hard
to attain and is at first paradoxical. The change of scale required is
violent and frustrates all the mind's rhetorical habits. There is a
constant feeling of strain and <a name="Page_82" id="Page_82" />much flying back to the mother-tongue of
myth and social symbol. Every wrong hypothesis is seized upon and is
tried before any one will entertain the right one. Enthusiasm for
knowledge is chilled by repeated failures and a great confusion cannot
but reign in philosophy. A man with an eye for characteristic features
in various provinces of experience is encouraged to deal with each upon
a different principle; and where these provinces touch or actually fuse,
he is at a loss what method of comprehension to apply. There sets in,
accordingly, a tendency to use various methods at once or a different
one on each occasion, as language, custom, or presumption seems to
demand. Science is reduced by philosophers to plausible discourse, and
the more plausible the discourse is, by leaning on all the heterogeneous
prejudices of the hour, the more does it foster the same and discourage
radical investigation.</p>

<p>Thus even Aristotle felt that good judgment and the dramatic habit of
things altogether excluded the simple physics of Democritus. Indeed, as
things then stood, Democritus had no right to his simplicity, except
that divine right which comes of inspiration. His was an indefensible
faith in a single radical insight, which happened nevertheless to be
true. To justify that insight forensically it would have been necessary
to change the range of human vision, making it telescopic in one region
and microscopic in another; whereby <a name="Page_83" id="Page_83" />the objects so transfigured would
have lost their familiar aspect and their habitual context in discourse.
Without such a startling change of focus nature can never seem
everywhere mechanical. Hence, even to this day, people with broad human
interests are apt to discredit a mechanical philosophy. Seldom can
penetration and courage in thinking hold their own against the
miscellaneous habits of discourse; and nobody remembers that moral
values must remain captious, and imaginative life ignoble and dark, so
long as the whole basis and application of them is falsely conceived.
Discoveries in science are made only by near-sighted specialists, while
the influence of public sentiment and policy still works systematically
against enlightenment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and speculation rendered necessary.</div>

<p>The maladaptation of sense to its objects has a second consequence: that
speculation is in a way nobler for man than direct perception. For
direct perception is wholly inadequate to render the force, the reality,
the subtle relations of the object perceived, unless this object be a
shell only, like a work of fine art, where nothing counts but the
surface. Since the function of perception is properly to give
understanding and dominion, direct perception is a defeat and, as it
were, an insult to the mind, thus forced to busy itself about so
unintelligible and dense an apparition. &AElig;sthetic enthusiasm cares
nothing about what the object inwardly is, what is its efficacious
movement and real life. It revels <a name="Page_84" id="Page_84" />selfishly in the harmonies of
perception itself, harmonies which perhaps it attributes to the object
through want of consideration. These &aelig;sthetic objects, which have no
intrinsic unity or cohesion, lapse in the most melancholy and
inexplicable fashion before our eyes. Then we cry that beauty wanes,
that life is brief, and that its prizes are deceptive. Our minds have
fed on casual aspects of nature, like tints in sunset clouds.
Imaginative fervour has poured itself out exclusively on these
apparitions, which are without relevant backing in the world; and long,
perhaps, before this life is over, which we called too brief, we begin
to pine for another, where just those images which here played so
deceptively on the surface of the flux may be turned into fixed and
efficacious realities. Meantime speculation amuses us with prophecies
about what such realities might be. We look for them, very likely, in
the wrong place, namely, in human poetry and eloquence, or at best in
dialectic; yet even when stated in these mythical terms the hidden world
divined in meditation seems nobler and, as we say, more real than the
objects of sense. For we hope, in those speculative visions, to reach
the permanent, the efficacious, the stanch principles of experience,
something to rely on in prospect and appeal to in perplexity.</p>

<p>Science, in its prosaic but trustworthy fashion, passes likewise beyond
the dreamlike unities and cadences which sense discloses; only, as
science aims at controlling its speculation by experiment, <a name="Page_85" id="Page_85" />the hidden
reality it discloses is exactly like what sense perceives, though on a
different scale, and not observable, perhaps, without a magic carpet of
hypothesis, to carry the observer to the ends of the universe or,
changing his dimensions, to introduce him into those infinitesimal
abysses where nature has her workshop. In this region, were it
sufficiently explored, we might find just those solid supports and
faithful warnings which we were looking for with such ill success in our
rhetorical speculations. The machinery disclosed would not be human; it
would be machinery. But it would for that very reason serve the purpose
which made us look for it instead of remaining, like the lower animals,
placidly gazing on the pageants of sense, till some unaccountable pang
forced us to spasmodic movement. It is doubtless better to find material
engines&mdash;not necessarily inanimate, either&mdash;which may really serve to
bring order, security, and progress into our lives, than to find
impassioned or ideal spirits, that can do nothing for us except, at
best, assure us that they are perfectly happy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissatisfaction with mechanism partly natural.</div>

<p>The reigning aversion to mechanism is partly natural and partly
artificial. The natural aversion cannot be wholly overcome. Like the
aversion to death, to old age, to labour, it is called forth by man's
natural situation in a world which was not made for him, but in which he
grew. That the efficacious structure of things should not <a name="Page_86" id="Page_86" />be
intentionally spectacular nor poetical, that its units should not be
terms in common discourse, nor its laws quite like the logic of passion,
is of course a hard lesson to learn. The learning, however&mdash;not to speak
of its incidental delights&mdash;is so extraordinarily good for people that
only with that instruction and the blessed renunciations it brings can
clearness, dignity, or virility enter their minds. And of course, if the
material basis of human strength could be discovered and better
exploited, the free activity of the mind would be not arrested but
enlarged. Geology adds something to the interest of landscape, and
botany much to the charm of flowers; natural history increases the
pleasure with which we view society and the justice with which we judge
it. An instinctive sympathy, a solicitude for the perfect working of any
delicate thing, as it makes the ruffian tender to a young child, is a
sentiment inevitable even toward artificial organisms. Could we better
perceive the fine fruits of order, the dire consequences of every
specific cruelty or jar, we should grow doubly considerate toward all
forms; for we exist through form, and the love of form is our whole real
inspiration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and partly artificial.</div>

<p>The artificial prejudice against mechanism is a fruit of party spirit.
When a myth has become the centre or sanction for habits and
institutions, these habits and institutions stand against any conception
incompatible with that myth. It matters nothing that the val<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87" />ues the
myth was designed to express may remain standing without it, or may be
transferred to its successor. Social and intellectual inertia is too
great to tolerate so simple an evolution. It divides opinions not into
false and true but into high and low, or even more frankly into those
which are acceptable and comforting to its ruffled faith and those which
are dangerous, alarming, and unfortunate. Imagine Socrates &quot;viewing with
alarm&quot; the implications of an argument! This artificial prejudice is
indeed modern and will not be eternal. Ancient sages, when they wished
to rebuke the atheist, pointed to the very heavens which a sentimental
religion would nowadays gladly prove to be unreal, lest the soul should
learn something of their method. Yet the Ptolemaic spheres were no more
manlike and far less rich in possibilities of life than the Copernican
star-dust. The ancients thought that what was intelligible was divine.
Order was what they meant by intelligence, and order productive of
excellence was what they meant by reason. When they noticed that the
stars moved perpetually and according to law, they seriously thought
they were beholding the gods. The stars as we conceive them are not in
that sense perfect. But the order which nature does not cease to
manifest is still typical of all order, and is sublime. It is from these
regions of embodied law that intelligibility and power combined come to
make their covenant with us, as with all generations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88" />Biassed judgments inspired by moral inertia.</div>

<p>The emotions and the moral principles that are naturally allied to
materialism suffer an eclipse when materialism, which is properly a
primary or dogmatic philosophy, breathing courage and victory, appears
as a destructive force and in the incongruous r&ocirc;le of a critic. One
dogmatism is not fit to criticise another; their conflict can end only
in insults, sullenness, and an appeal to that physical drift and
irrational selection which may ultimately consign one party to oblivion.
But a philosophy does ill to boast of such borrowed triumphs. The next
turn of the wheel may crush the victor, and the opinions hastily buried
may rise again to pose as the fashionable and superior insights of a
later day. To criticise dogmatism it is necessary to be a genuine
sceptic, an honest transcendentalist, that falls back on the immediate
and observes by what principles of logical architecture the ultimate,
the reality discovered, has been inferred from it. Such criticism is not
necessarily destructive; some construction and some belief being
absolutely inevitable, if reason and life are to operate at all,
criticism merely offers us the opportunity of revising and purifying our
dogmas, so as to make them reasonable and congruous with practice.
Materialism may thus be reinstated on transcendental grounds, and the
dogma at first uttered in the flush of intelligent perception, with no
scruple or self-consciousness, may be repeated after a thorough
examina<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89" />tion of heart, on the ground that it is the best possible
expression of experience, the inevitable deliverance of thought. So
approached, a dogmatic system will carry its critical justification with
it, and the values it enshrines and secures will not be doubtful. The
emotions it arouses will be those aroused by the experience it explains.
Causes having been found for what is given, these causes will be proved
to have just that beneficent potency and just that distressing
inadequacy which the joys and failures of life show that the reality
has, whatever this reality may otherwise be. The theory will add nothing
except the success involved in framing it. Life being once for all what
it is, no physics can render it worse or better, save as the knowledge
of physics, with insight into the causes of our varied fortunes, is
itself an achievement and a new resource.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Positive emotions proper to materialism.</div>

<p>A theory is not an unemotional thing. If music can be full of passion,
merely by giving form to a single sense, how much more beauty or terror
may not a vision be pregnant with which brings order and method into
everything that we know. Materialism has its distinct &aelig;sthetic and
emotional colour, though this may be strangely affected and even
reversed by contrast with systems of an incongruous hue, jostling it
accidentally in a confused and amphibious mind. If you are in the habit
of believing in special providences, or of expecting to continue your
romantic adventures in a second life, materialism will dash your hopes
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" />most unpleasantly, and you may think for a year or two that you have
nothing left to live for. But a thorough materialist, one born to the
faith and not half plunged into it by an unexpected christening in cold
water, will be like the superb Democritus, a laughing philosopher. His
delight in a mechanism that can fall into so many marvellous and
beautiful shapes, and can generate so many exciting passions, should be
of the same intellectual quality as that which the visitor feels in a
museum of natural history, where he views the myriad butterflies in
their cases, the flamingoes and shell-fish, the mammoths and gorillas.
Doubtless there were pangs in that incalculable life, but they were soon
over; and how splendid meantime was the pageant, how infinitely
interesting the universal interplay, and how foolish and inevitable
those absolute little passions. Somewhat of that sort might be the
sentiment that materialism would arouse in a vigorous mind, active,
joyful, impersonal, and in respect to private illusions not without a
touch of scorn.</p>

<p>To the genuine sufferings of living creatures the ethics that
accompanies materialism has never been insensible; on the contrary, like
other merciful systems, it has trembled too much at pain and tended to
withdraw the will ascetically, lest the will should be defeated.
Contempt for mortal sorrows is reserved for those who drive with
hosannas the Juggernaut car of absolute optimism. But <a name="Page_91" id="Page_91" />against evils
born of pure vanity and self-deception, against the verbiage by which
man persuades himself that he is the goal and acme of the universe,
laughter is the proper defence. Laughter also has this subtle advantage,
that it need not remain without an overtone of sympathy and brotherly
understanding; as the laughter that greets Don Quixote's absurdities and
misadventures does not mock the hero's intent. His ardour was admirable,
but the world must be known before it can be reformed pertinently, and
happiness, to be attained, must be placed in reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The material world not dead nor ugly,</div>

<p>Oblivious of Democritus, the unwilling materialists of our day have
generally been awkwardly intellectual and quite incapable of laughter.
If they have felt anything, they have felt melancholy. Their allegiance
and affection were still fixed on those mythical sentimental worlds
which they saw to be illusory. The mechanical world they believed in
could not please them, in spite of its extent and fertility. Giving
rhetorical vent to their spleen and prejudice, they exaggerated nature's
meagreness and mathematical dryness. When their imagination was chilled
they spoke of nature, most unwarrantably, as dead, and when their
judgment was heated they took the next step and called it unreal. A man
is not blind, however, because every part of his body is not an eye, nor
every muscle in his eye a nerve sensitive to light. Why, then, is nature
dead, although it swarms with living <a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" />organisms, if every part is not
obviously animate? And why is the sun dark and cold, if it is bright and
hot only to animal sensibility? This senseless lamentation is like the
sophism of those Indian preachers who, to make men abandon the illusions
of self-love, dilated on the shocking contents of the human body. Take
off the skin, they cried, and you will discover nothing but loathsome
bleeding and quivering substances. Yet the inner organs are well enough
in their place and doubtless pleasing to the microbes that inhabit them;
and a man is not hideous because his cross-section would not offer the
features of a beautiful countenance. So the structure of the world is
not therefore barren or odious because, if you removed its natural outer
aspect and effects, it would not make an interesting landscape. Beauty
being an appearance and life an operation, that is surely beautiful and
living which so operates and so appears as to manifest those qualities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">nor especially cruel.</div>

<p>It is true that materialism prophesies an ultimate extinction for man
and all his works. The horror which this prospect inspires in the
natural man might be mitigated by reflection; but, granting the horror,
is it something introduced by mechanical theories and not present in
experience itself? Are human things inwardly stable? Do they belong to
the eternal in any sense in which the operation of material forces can
touch their immortality? The panic which seems to seize some minds at
the thought of a <a name="Page_93" id="Page_93" />merely natural existence is something truly
hysterical; and yet one wonders why ultimate peace should seem so
intolerable to people who not so many years ago found a stern religious
satisfaction in consigning almost the whole human race to perpetual
torture, the Creator, as Saint Augustine tells us, having in his
infinite wisdom and justice devised a special kind of material fire that
might avail to burn resurrected bodies for ever without consuming them.
A very real truth might be read into this savage symbol, if we
understood it to express the ultimate defeats and fruitless agonies that
pursue human folly; and so we might find that it gave mythical
expression to just that conditioned fortune and inexorable flux which a
mechanical philosophy shows us the grounds of. Our own vices in another
man seem particularly hideous; and so those actual evils which we take
for granted when incorporated in the current system strike us afresh
when we see them in a new setting. But it is not mechanical science that
introduced mutability into things nor materialism that invented death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mechanism to be judged by its fruits.</div>

<p>The death of individuals, as we observe daily in nature, does not
prevent the reappearance of life; and if we choose to indulge in
arbitrary judgments on a subject where data fail us, we may as
reasonably wish that there might be less life as that there might be
more. The passion for a large and permanent population in the universe
is not <a name="Page_94" id="Page_94" />obviously rational; at a great distance a man must view
everything, including himself, under the form of eternity, and when life
is so viewed its length or its diffusion becomes a point of little
importance. What matters then is quality. The reasonable and humane
demand to make of the world is that such creatures as exist should not
be unhappy and that life, whatever its quantity, should have a quality
that may justify it in its own eyes. This just demand, made by
conscience and not by an arbitrary fancy, the world described by
mechanism does not fulfil altogether, for adjustments in it are
tentative, and much friction must precede and follow upon any vital
equilibrium attained. This imperfection, however, is actual, and no
theory can overcome it except by verbal fallacies and scarcely deceptive
euphemisms. What mechanism involves in this respect is exactly what we
find: a tentative appearance of life in many quarters, its disappearance
in some, and its reinforcement and propagation in others, where the
physical equilibrium attained insures to it a natural stability and a
natural prosperity.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>HESITATIONS IN METHOD</p>


<div class="sidenote">Mechanism restricted to one-half of existence.</div>

<p>When Democritus proclaimed the sovereignty of mechanism, he did so in
the oracular fashion proper to an ancient sage. He found it no harder to
apply his atomic theory to the mind and to the gods than to solids and
fluids. It sufficed to conceive that such an explanation might be
possible, and to illustrate the theory by a few scattered facts and
trenchant hypotheses. When Descartes, after twenty centuries of verbal
physics, reintroduced mechanism into philosophy, he made a striking
modification in its claims. He divided existence into two independent
regions, and it was only in one, in the realm of extended things, that
mechanism was expected to prevail. Mental facts, which he approached
from the side of abstracted reflection and Platonic ideas, seemed to him
obviously non-extended, even when they represented extension; and with
them mechanism could have nothing to do. Descartes had recovered in the
science of mechanics a firm nucleus for physical theory, a stronghold
from which it had <a name="Page_96" id="Page_96" />become impossible to dislodge scientific methods.
There, at any rate, form, mass, distance, and other mathematical
relations governed the transformation of things. Yet the very clearness
and exhaustiveness of this mechanical method, as applied to gross masses
in motion, made it seem essentially inapplicable to anything else.
Descartes was far too radical and incisive a thinker, however, not to
feel that it must apply throughout nature. Imaginative difficulties due
to the complexity of animal bodies could not cloud his rational insight.
Animal bodies, then, were mere machines, cleancut and cold engines like
so many anatomical manikins. They explained themselves and all their
operations, talking and building temples being just as truly a matter of
physics as the revolution of the sky. But the soul had dropped out, and
Descartes was the last man to ignore the soul. There had dropped out
also the secondary qualities of matter, all those qualities, namely,
which are negligible in mechanical calculations. Mechanism was in truth
far from universal; all mental facts and half the properties of matter,
as matter is revealed to man, came into being without asking leave; they
were interlopers in the intelligible universe. Indeed, Descartes was
willing to admit that these inexplicable bystanders might sometimes put
their finger in the pie, and stir the material world judiciously so as
to give it a new direction, although without adding to its substance or
to its force.</p>

<p><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97" />The situation so created gave the literary philosophers an excellent
chance to return to the attack and to swallow and digest the new-born
mechanism in their facile systems. Theologians and metaphysicians in one
quarter and psychologists in another found it easy and inevitable to
treat the whole mechanical world as a mere idea. In that case, it is
true, the only existences that remained remained entirely without
calculable connections; everything was a divine trance or a shower of
ideas falling by chance through the void. But this result might not be
unwelcome. It fell in well enough with that love of emotional issues,
that want of soberness and want of cogency, which is so characteristic
of modern philosophers. Christian theology still remained the background
and chief point of reference for speculation; if its eclectic dogmas
could be in part supported or in part undermined, that constituted a
sufficient literary success, and what became of science was of little
moment in comparison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Men of science not speculative.</div>

<p>Science, to be sure, could very well take care of itself and proceeded
in its patient course without caring particularly what status the
metaphysicians might assign to it. Not to be a philosopher is even an
advantage for a man of science, because he is then more willing to adapt
his methods to the state of knowledge in his particular subject, without
insisting on ultimate intelligibility; and he has perhaps more joy of
his discoveries than he might <a name="Page_98" id="Page_98" />have if he had discounted them in his
speculations. Darwin, for instance, did more than any one since Newton
to prove that mechanism is universal, but without apparently believing
that it really was so, or caring about the question at all. In natural
history, observation has not yet come within range of accurate
processes; it merely registers habits and traces empirical derivations.
Even in chemistry, while measure and proportion are better felt, the
ultimate units and the radical laws are still problematical. The recent
immense advances in science have been in acquaintance with nature rather
than in insight. Greater complexity, greater regularity, greater
<i>naturalness</i> have been discovered everywhere; the profound analogies in
things, their common evolution, have appeared unmistakably; but the
inner texture of the process has not been laid bare.</p>

<p>This cautious peripheral attack, which does so much honour to the
scientific army and has won it so many useful victories, is another
proof that science is nothing but common knowledge extended. It is
willing to reckon in any terms and to study any subject-matter; where it
cannot see necessity it will notice law; where laws cannot be stated it
will describe habits; where habits fail it will classify types; and
where types even are indiscernible it will not despise statistics. In
this way studies which are scientific in spirit, however loose their
results, may be carried on in social matters, in political economy, in
anthropology, in <a name="Page_99" id="Page_99" />psychology. The historical sciences, also, philology
and arch&aelig;ology, have reached tentatively very important results; it is
enough that an intelligent man should gather in any quarter a rich fund
of information, for the movement of his subject to pass somehow to his
mind: and if his apprehension follows that movement&mdash;not breaking in
upon it with extraneous matter&mdash;it will be scientific apprehension.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confusion in semi-moral subjects.</div>

<p>What confuses and retards science in these ambiguous regions is the
difficulty of getting rid of the foreign element, or even of deciding
what the element native to the object is. In political economy, for
instance, it is far from clear whether the subject is moral, and
therefore to be studied and expressed dialectically, or whether it is
descriptive, and so in the end a matter of facts and of mechanics. Are
you formulating an interest or tracing a sequence of events? And if both
simultaneously, are you studying the world in order to see what acts, in
a given situation, would serve your purpose and so be right, or are you
taking note of your own intentions, and of those of other people, in
order to infer from them the probable course of affairs? In the first
case you are a moralist observing nature in order to use it; you are
defining a policy, and that definition is not knowledge of anything
except of your own heart. Neither you nor any one else may ever take
such a single-minded and unchecked course in the world as the one you
are <a name="Page_100" id="Page_100" />excogitating. No one may ever have been guided in the past by any
such absolute plan.</p>

<p>For this same reason, if (to take up the other supposition) you are a
naturalist studying the actual movement of affairs, you would do well
not to rely on the conscious views or intentions of anybody. A natural
philosopher is on dangerous ground when he uses psychological or moral
terms in his calculation. If you use such terms&mdash;and to forbid their use
altogether would be pedantic&mdash;you should take them for conventional
literary expressions, covering an unsolved problem; for these views and
intentions have a brief and inconsequential tenure of life and their
existence is merely a sign for certain conjunctions in nature, where
processes hailing from afar have met in a man, soon to pass beyond him.
If they figure as causes in nature, it is only because they represent
the material processes that have brought them into being. The
existential element in mental facts is not so remote from matter as
Descartes imagined. Even if we are not prepared to admit with Democritus
that matter is what makes them up (as it well might if &quot;matter&quot; were
taken in a logical sense)<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2" /><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> we should agree that their substance is in
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101" />mechanical flux, and that their form, by which they become moral
unities, is only an ideal aspect <a name="Page_102" id="Page_102" />of that moving substance. Moral
unities are created by a point of view, as right and left are, and for
that reason are not efficacious; though of course the existences they
enclose, like the things lying to the left and to the right, move in
unison with the rest of nature.</p>

<p>People doubtless do well to keep an eye open for morals when they study
physics, and <i>vice versa</i>, since it is only by feeling how the two
spheres hang together that the Life of Reason can be made to walk on
both feet. Yet to discriminate between the two is no scholastic
subtlety. There is the same practical inconvenience in taking one for
the other as in trying to gather grapes from thistles. A hybrid science
is sterile. If the reason escapes us, history should at least convince
us of the fact, when we remember the issue of Aristotelian physics and
of cosmological morals. Where the subject-matter is ambiguous and the
method double, you have scarcely reached a result which seems plausible
for the moment, when a rival school springs up, adopting and bringing
forward the submerged element in your view, and rejecting your
achievement altogether. A seesaw and endless controversy thus take the
place of a steady, co-operative advance. This disorder reigns in morals,
metaphysics, and psychology, and the conflicting schools of political
economy and of history loudly proclaim it to the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">&quot;Physic of metaphysic begs defence.&quot;</div>

<p>The modesty of men of science, their aversion (or incapacity) to carry
their principles over into <a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" />speculation, has left the greater part of
physics or the theory of existence to the metaphysicians. What they have
made of it does not concern us here, since the result has certainly not
been a science; indeed they have obscured the very notion that there
should be a science of all existence and that metaphysics, if it is more
than a name for ultimate physics, can be nothing but dialectic, which
does not look toward existence at all. But the prevalence of a mythical
physics, purporting to describe the structure of the universe in terms
quite other than those which scientific physics could use, has affected
this scientific physics and seriously confused it. Its core, in
mechanics, to be sure, could not be touched; and the detail even of
natural history and chemistry could not be disfigured: but the general
aspect of natural history could be rendered ambiguous in the doctrine of
evolution; while in psychology, which attempted to deal with that half
of the world which Descartes had not subjected to mechanism, confusion
could hold undisputed sway.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evolution by mechanism.</div>

<p>There is a sense in which the notion of evolution is involved in any
mechanical system. Descartes indeed had gone so far as to describe, in
strangely simple terms, how the world, with all its detail, might have
been produced by starting any motion anywhere in the midst of a plenum
at rest. The idea of evolution could not be more curtly put forth; so
much so <a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" />that Descartes had to arm himself against the inevitable charge
that he was denying the creation, by protesting that his doctrine was a
supposition contrary to fact, and that though the world <i>might</i> have
been so formed, it was really created as Genesis recorded. Moreover, in
antiquity, every Ionian philosopher had conceived a gradual
crystallisation of nature; while Empedocles, in his magnificent oracles,
had anticipated Darwin's philosophy without Darwin's knowledge. It is
clear that if the forces that hold an organism together are mechanical,
and therefore independent of the ideal unities they subtend, those
forces suffice to explain the origin of the organism, and can have
produced it. Darwin's discoveries, like every other advance in physical
insight, are nothing but filling for that abstract assurance. They show
us how the supposed mechanism really works in one particular field, in
one stage of its elaboration. As earlier naturalists had shown us how
mechanical causes might produce the miracle of the sunrise and the
poetry of the seasons, so Darwin showed us how similar causes might
secure the adaptation of animals to their habitat. Evolution, so
conceived, is nothing but a detailed account of mechanical origins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evolution by ideal attraction.</div>

<p>At the same time the word evolution has a certain pomp and glamour about
it which fits ill with so prosaic an interpretation. In the unfolding of
a bud we are wont to see, as it were, the fulfilment of a prede<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105" />termined
and glorious destiny; for the seed was an epitome or condensation of a
full-blown plant and held within it, in some sort of potential guise,
the very form which now peeps out in the young flower. Evolution
suggests a prior involution or contraction and the subsequent
manifestation of an innate ideal. Evolution should move toward a fixed
consummation the approaches to which we might observe and measure. Yet
evolution, in this prophetic sense of the word, would be the exact
denial of what Darwin, for instance, was trying to prove. It would be a
return to Aristotelian notions of heredity and potential being; for it
was the essence of Aristotle's physics&mdash;of which his theology was an
integral part and a logical capping&mdash;that the forms which beings
approached pre-existed in other beings from which they had been
inherited, and that the intermediate stages during which the butterfly
shrank to a grub could not be understood unless we referred them to
their origin and their destiny. The physical essence and potency of
seeds lay in their ideal relations, not in any actual organisation they
might possess in the day of their eclipse and slumber. An egg evolved
into a chicken not by mechanical necessity&mdash;for an egg had a
comparatively simple structure&mdash;but by virtue of an ideal harmony in
things; since it was natural and fitting that what had come from a hen
should lead on to a hen again. The ideal nature possessed by the parent,
hovering over the passive seed, magically induced <a name="Page_106" id="Page_106" />it to grow into the
parent's semblance; and growth was the gradual approach to the
perfection which this ancestral essence prescribed. This was why
Aristotle's God, though in character an unmistakable ideal, had to be at
the same time an actual existence; since the world would not have known
which way to move or what was its inner ideal, unless this ideal,
already embodied somewhere else, drew it on and infused movement and
direction into the world's structureless substance.</p>

<p>The underlying Platonism in this magical physics is obvious, since the
natures that Aristotle made to rule the world were eternal natures. An
individual might fail to be a perfect man or a perfect monkey, but the
specific human or simian ideal, by which he had been formed in so far as
he was formed at all, was not affected by this accidental resistance in
the matter at hand, as an adamantine seal, even if at times the wax by
defect or impurity failed to receive a perfect impression, would remain
unchanged and ready to be stamped perpetually on new material.</p>

<div class="sidenote">If species are evolved they cannot guide evolution.</div>

<p>The contrast is obvious between this Platonic physics and a naturalism
like that of Darwin. The point of evolution, as selection produces it,
is that new species may arise. The very title of Darwin's book &quot;The
Origin of Species&quot; is a denial of Aristotelianism and, in the pregnant
sense, of evolution. It suggests that the type approached by each
generation may differ from that <a name="Page_107" id="Page_107" />approached by the previous one; that
not merely the degree of perfection, but the direction of growth, may
vary. The individual is not merely unfolded from an inner potentiality
derived from a like ancestor and carrying with it a fixed eternal ideal,
but on the contrary the very ground plan of organisation may gradually
change and a new form and a new ideal may appear. Spontaneous
variations&mdash;of course mechanically caused<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3" /><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>&mdash;may occur and may modify
the hereditary form of animals. These variations, superposed upon one
another, may in time constitute a nature wholly unlike its first
original. This accidental, cumulative evolution accordingly justifies a
declaration of moral liberty. I am not obliged to aspire to the nature
my father aspired to, for the ground of my being is partly new. In me
nature is making a novel experiment. I am the adoring <a name="Page_108" id="Page_108" />creator of a new
spiritual good. My duties have shifted with my shifting faculties, and
the ideal which I propose to myself, and alone can honestly propose, is
unprecedented, the expression of a moving existence and without
authority beyond the range of existences congruous with mine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intrusion of optimism.</div>

<p>All that is scientific or Darwinian in the theory of evolution is
accordingly an application of mechanism, a proof that mechanism lies at
the basis of life and morals. The Aristotelian notion of development,
however, was too deeply rooted in tradition for it to disappear at a
breath. Evolution as conceived by Hegel, for instance, or even by
Spencer, retained Aristotelian elements, though these were disguised and
hidden under a cloud of new words. Both identify evolution with
progress, with betterment; a notion which would naturally be prominent
in any one with enlightened sympathies living in the nineteenth century,
when a new social and intellectual order was forcing itself on a world
that happened largely to welcome the change, but a notion that has
nothing to do with natural science. The fittest to live need not be
those with the most harmonious inner life nor the best possibilities.
The fitness might be due to numbers, as in a political election, or to
tough fibre, as in a tropical climate. Of course a form of being that
circumstances make impossible or hopelessly laborious had better dive
under and cease for the moment to be; but the circumstances that render
it inopportune do not <a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" />render it essentially inferior. Circumstances
have no power of that kind; and perhaps the worst incident in the
popular acceptance of evolution has been a certain brutality thereby
introduced into moral judgment, an abdication of human ideals, a mocking
indifference to justice, under cover of respect for what is bound to be,
and for the rough economy of the world. Disloyalty to the good in the
guise of philosophy had appeared also among the ancients, when their
political ethics had lost its authority, just as it appeared among us
when the prestige of religion had declined. The Epicureans sometimes
said that one should pursue pleasure because all the animals did so, and
the Stoics that one should fill one's appointed place in nature, because
such was the practice of clouds and rivers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evolution according to Hegel.</div>

<p>Hegel possessed a keen scent for instability in men's attitudes and
opinions; he had no need of Darwin's facts to convince him that in moral
life, at least, there were no permanent species and that every posture
of thought was an untenable half-way station between two others. His
early contact with Protestant theology may have predisposed him to that
opinion. At any rate he had no sympathy with that Platonism that allowed
everything to have its eternal ideal, with which it might ultimately be
identified. Such ideals would be finite, they would arrest the flux, and
they would try to break loose from their enveloping conditions. Hegel
was no <a name="Page_110" id="Page_110" />moralist in the Socratic sense, but a naturalist seeking
formulas for the growth of moral experience. Instead of questioning the
heart, he somewhat satirically described its history. At the same time
he was heir to that mythology which had deified the genetic or physical
principle in things, and though the traditional myths suffered cruel
operations at his hands, and often died of explanation, the mythical
principle itself remained untouched and was the very breath of his
nostrils. He never doubted that the formula he might find for the growth
of experience would be also the ultimate good. What other purpose could
the world have than to express the formula according to which it was
being generated?</p>

<p>In this honest conviction we see the root, perhaps, of that distaste for
correct physics that prevails among many who call themselves idealists.
If physics were for some reason to be adored, it would be disconcerting
to find in physics nothing but atoms and a void. It is hard to
understand, however, why a fanciful formula expressing the evolution of
this perturbed universe, and painting it no better than it is, should be
more worshipful than an exact formula meant to perform the same office.
A myth that enlarged the world and promised a complete transformation of
its character might have its charms; but the improvement is not obvious
that accrues by making the drift of things, just as it drifts, its own
standard. Yet for Hegel it mattered nothing how unstable all <a name="Page_111" id="Page_111" />ideals
might be, since the only use of them was to express a principle of
transition, and this principle was being realised, eternally and
unawares, by the self-devouring and self-transcending purposes rolling
in the flux.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conservative interpretation.</div>

<p>This philosophy might not be much relished if it were more frankly
expressed; yet something of the sort floats vaguely before most minds
when they think of evolution. The types of being change, they say: in
this sense the Aristotelian notion of a predetermined form unfolding
itself in each species has yielded to a more correct and more dynamic
physics. But the changes, so people imagine, express a predetermined
ideal, no longer, of course, the ideal of these specific things, but one
overarching the cosmic movement. The situation might be described by
saying that this is Aristotle's view adapted to a world in which there
is only one species or only one individual. The earlier phases of life
are an imperfect expression of the same nature which the later phases
express more fully. Hence the triumphant march of evolution and the
assumption that whatever is later is necessarily better than what went
before. If a child were simply the partial expression of a man, his
single desire would be to grow up, and when he was grown up he would
embody all he had been striving for and would be happy for ever after.
So if man were nothing but a halting reproduction of divinity and
destined to become God, <a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" />his whole destiny would be fulfilled by
apotheosis. If this apotheosis, moreover, were an actual future event,
something every man and animal was some day to experience, evolution
might really have a final goal, and might lead to a new and presumably
better sort of existence&mdash;existence in the eternal. Somewhat in this
fashion evolution is understood by the party that wish to combine it
with a refreshed patristic theology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The radical one.</div>

<p>There is an esoteric way, however, of taking these matters which is more
in sympathy both with natural evolution and with transcendental
philosophy. If we assert that evolution is infinite, no substantive goal
can be set to it. The goal will be the process itself, if we could only
open our eyes upon its beauty and necessity. The apotheosis will be
retroactive, nay, it has already taken place. The insight involved is
mystical, yet in a way more just to the facts than any promise of
ulterior blisses. For it is not really true that a child has no other
ideal than to become a man. Childhood has many an ideal of its own, many
a beauty and joy irrelevant to manhood, and such that manhood is
incapable of retaining or containing them. If the ultimate good is
really to contain and retain all the others, it can hardly be anything
but their totality&mdash;the infinite history of experience viewed under the
form of eternity. At that remove, however, the least in the kingdom of
Heaven is even as the greatest, and the idea of evolution, as of time,
is &quot;<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113" />taken up into a higher unity.&quot; There could be no real pre-eminence
in one man's works over those of another; and if faith, or insight into
the equal service done by all, still seemed a substantial privilege
reserved for the elect, this privilege, too, must be an illusion, since
those who do not know how useful and necessary they are must be as
useful and necessary as those who do. An absolute preference for
knowledge or self-consciousness would be an unmistakably human and
finite ideal&mdash;something to be outgrown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Megalomania.</div>

<p>What practically survives in these systems, when their mysticism and
naturalism have had time to settle, is a clear enough standard. It is a
standard of inclusion and quantity. Since all is needful, and the
justifying whole is infinite, there would seem to be a greater dignity
in the larger part. As the best copy of a picture, other things being
equal, would be one that represented it all, so the best expression of
the world, next to the world itself, would be the largest portion of it
any one could absorb. Progress would then mean annexation. Growth would
not come by expressing better an innate soul which involved a particular
ideal, but by assimilating more and more external things till the
original soul, by their influence, was wholly recast and unrecognisable.
This moral agility would be true merit; we should always be &quot;striving
onward.&quot; Life would be a sort of demonic vortex, boiling at the centre
and omnivorous at the cir<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114" />cumference, till it finally realised the
supreme vocation of vortices, to have &quot;their centre everywhere and their
circumference nowhere.&quot; This somewhat troubled situation might seem
sublime to us, transformed as we too should be; and so we might reach
the most remarkable and doubtless the &quot;highest&quot; form of
optimism&mdash;optimism in hell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chaos in the theory of mind.</div>

<p>Confusing as these cross-currents and revulsions may prove in the field
where mechanism is more or less at home, in the field of material
operations, they are nothing to the primeval chaos that still broods
over the other hemisphere, over the mental phase of existence. The
difficulty is not merely that no mechanism is discovered or acknowledged
here, but that the phenomena themselves are ambiguous, and no one seems
to know when he speaks of mind whether he means something formal and
ideal, like Platonic essences and mathematical truths, or reflection and
intelligence, or sensation possessing external causes and objects, or
finally that ultimate immediacy or brute actuality which is
characteristic of any existence. Other even vaguer notions are doubtless
often designated by the word psychical; but these may suffice for us to
recognise the initial dilemmas in the subject and the futility of trying
to build a science of mind, or defining the relation of mind to matter,
when it is not settled whether mind means the form of matter, as with
the Platonists, or the <a name="Page_115" id="Page_115" />effect of it, as with the materialists, or the
seat and false knowledge of it, as with the transcendentalists, or
perhaps after all, as with the pan-psychists, mind means exactly matter
itself.<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4" /><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of self-consciousness.</div>

<p>To see how equivocal everything is in this region, and possibly to catch
some glimpse of whatever science or sciences might some day define it,
we may revert for a moment to the origin of human notions concerning the
mind. If either <a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" />everything or nothing that men came upon in their
primitive day-dream had been continuous in its own category and
traceable through the labyrinth of the world, no mind and no
self-consciousness need ever have appeared at all. The world might have
been as magical as it pleased; it would have remained single, one
budding sequence of forms with no transmissible substance beneath them.
These forms might have had properties we now call physical and at the
same time qualities we now call mental or emotional; there is nothing
originally incongruous in such a mixture, chaotic and perverse as it may
seem from the vantage-ground of subsequent distinctions. Existence might
as easily have had any other form whatsoever as the one we discover it
to have in fact. And primitive men, not having read Descartes, and not
having even distinguished their waking from their dreaming life nor
their passions from their environment, might well stand in the presence
of facts that seem to us full of inward incongruity and contradiction;
indeed, it is only because original data were of that chaotic sort that
we call ourselves intelligent for having disentangled them and assigned
them to distinct sequences and alternative spheres.</p>

<p>The ambiguities and hesitations of theory, down to our own day, are not
all artificial or introduced gratuitously by sophists. Even where
prejudice obstructs progress, that prejudice itself has some ancient and
ingenuous source. Our perplexities <a name="Page_117" id="Page_117" />are traces of a primitive total
confusion; our doubts are remnants of a quite gaping ignorance. It was
impossible to say whether the phantasms that first crossed this earthly
scene were merely instinct with passion or were veritable passions
stalking through space. Material and mental elements, connections
natural and dialectical, existed mingled in that chaos. Light was as yet
inseparable from inward vitality and pain drew a visible cloud across
the sky. Civilised life is that early dream partly clarified; science is
that dense mythology partly challenged and straightened out.</p>

<p>The flux, however, was meantime full of method, if only discrimination
and enlarged experience could have managed to divine it. Its
inconstancy, for one thing, was not so entire that no objects could be
fixed within it, or marshalled in groups, like the birds that flock
together. Animals could be readily distinguished from the things about
them, their rate of mobility being so much quicker; and one animal in
particular would at once be singled out, a more constant follower than
any dog, and one whose energies were not merely felt but often
spontaneously exerted&mdash;a phenomenon which appeared in no other part of
the world. This singular animal every one called himself. One object was
thus discovered to be the vehicle for perceiving and affecting all the
others, a movable seat or tower from which the world might be surveyed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118" />The notion of spirit.</div>

<p>The external influences to which this body, with its discoursing mind,
seemed to be subject were by no means all visible and material. Just as
one's own body was moved by passions and thoughts which no one else
could see&mdash;and this secrecy was a subject for much wonder and
self-congratulation&mdash;so evidently other things had a spirit within or
above them to endow them with wit and power. It was not so much to
contain sensation that this spirit was needed (for the body could very
well feel) as to contrive plans of action and discharge sudden force
into the world on momentous occasions. How deep-drawn, how far-reaching,
this spirit might be was not easily determined; but it seemed to have
unaccountable ways and to come and go from distant habitations. Things
past, for instance, were still open to its inspection; the mind was not
credited with constructing a fresh image of the past which might more or
less resemble that past; a ray of supernatural light, rather, sometimes
could pierce to the past itself and revisit its unchangeable depths. The
future, though more rarely, was open to spirit in exactly the same
fashion; destiny could on occasion be observed. Things distant and
preternatural were similarly seen in dreams. There could be no doubt
that all those objects existed; the only question was where they might
lie and in what manner they might operate. A vision was a visitation and
a dream was a journey. The spirit was a great traveller, and just as it
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" />could dart in every direction over both space and time, so it could
come thence into a man's presence or even into his body, to take
possession of it. Sense and fancy, in a word, had not been
distinguished. As to be aware of vision is a great sign of imagination,
so to be aware of imagination is a great sign of understanding.</p>

<p>The spirit had other prerogatives, of a more rational sort. The truth,
the right were also spirits; for though often invisible and denied by
men, they could emerge at times from their invisible lairs to deal some
quick blow and vindicate their divinity. The intermittance proper to
phenomena is universal and extreme; only the familiar conception of
nature, in which the flux becomes continuous, now blinds us in part to
that fact. But before the days of scientific thinking only those things
which were found unchanged and which seemed to lie passive were
conceived to have had in the interval a material existence. More
stirring apparitions, instead of being referred to their material
constituents and continuous basis in nature, were referred to spirit. We
still say, for instance, that war <i>comes on</i>. That phrase would once
have been understood literally. War, being something intermittent, must
exist somehow unseen in the interval, else it would not return; that
rage, so people would have fancied, is therefore a spirit, it is a god.
Mars and Ares long survived the phase of thought to which they owed
their divinity; and believers had to rely on habit <a name="Page_120" id="Page_120" />and the witness of
antiquity to support their irrational faith. They little thought how
absolutely simple and inevitable had been the grammar by which those
figures, since grown rhetorical, had been first imposed upon the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The notion of sense.</div>

<p>Another complication soon came to increase this confusion. When material
objects were discovered and it became clear that they had comparatively
fixed natures, it also became clear that with the motions of one's body
all other things seemed to vary in ways which did not amount to a
permanent or real metamorphosis in them; for these things might be found
again unchanged. Objects, for instance, seemed to grow smaller when we
receded from them, though really, as we discovered by approaching and
measuring them anew, they had remained unchanged. These private aspects
or views of things were accordingly distinguished from the things
themselves, which were lodged in an intelligible sphere, raised above
anybody's sensibility and existing independently. The variable aspects
were due to the body; they accompanied its variations and depended on
its presence and organs. They were conceived vaguely to exist in one's
head or, if they were emotional, in one's heart; but anatomy would have
had some difficulty in finding them there. They constituted what is
properly called the mind&mdash;the region of sentience, emotion, and
soliloquy.</p>

<p>The mind was the region where those aspects <a name="Page_121" id="Page_121" />which real things present
to the body might live and congregate. So understood, it was avowedly
and from the beginning a realm of mere appearance and depended entirely
on the body. It should be observed, however, that the limbo of divine
and ideal things, which is sometimes also called the mind, is very far
from depending obviously on the body and is said to do so only by a late
school of psychological sceptics. To primitive apprehension spirit, with
its ideal prerogatives, was something magical and oracular. Its
prophetic intuitions were far from being more trivial than material
appearances. On the contrary those intuitions were momentous and
inspiring. Their scope was indefinite and their value incalculable in
every sense of the word. The disembodied spirit might well be immortal,
since absent and dead things were familiar to it. It was by nature
present wherever truth and reality might be found. It was prophetic; the
dreams it fell into were full of auguries and secret affinities with
things to come. Myth and legend, hatched in its womb, were felt to be
divinely inspired, and genius seemed to be the Muses' voice heard in a
profound abstraction, when vulgar perception yielded to some kind of
clairvoyance having a higher authority than sense. Such a spirit might
naturally be expected to pass into another world, since it already dwelt
there at intervals, and brought thence its mysterious reports. Its
incursions into the physical sphere alone seemed <a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" />miraculous and sent a
thrill of awe through the unaccustomed flesh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Competition between the two.</div>

<p>The ideal element in the world was accordingly regarded at first as
something sacred and terrifying. It was no vulgar presence or private
product, and though its destiny might be to pass half the time, like
Persephone, under ground, it could not really be degraded. The human
mind, on the other hand, the region of sentience and illusion, was a
familiar affair enough. This familiarity, indeed, for a long time bred
contempt and philosophers did not think the personal equation of
individuals, or the refraction of things in sense, a very important or
edifying subject for study. In time, however, sentience had its revenge.
As each man's whole experience is bound to his body no less than is the
most trivial optical illusion, the sphere of sense is the transcendental
ground or <i>ratio cognoscendi</i> of every other sphere. It suffices,
therefore, to make philosophy retrospective and to relax the practical
and dogmatic stress under which the intellect operates, for all the
discoveries made through experience to collapse into the experience in
which they were made. A complete collapse of objects is indeed
inconvenient, because it would leave no starting-point for reasoning and
no faith in the significance of reason itself; but partial collapses,
now in the region of physics, now in that of logic and morals, are very
easy and exciting feats for criticism to perform.</p>

<p><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" />Passions when abstracted from their bodily causes and values when
removed from their objects will naturally fall into the body's mind, and
be allied with appearances. Shrewd people will bethink themselves to
attribute almost all the body's acts to some preparatory intention or
motive in its mind, and thus attain what they think knowledge of human
nature. They will encourage themselves to live among dramatic fictions,
as when absorbed in a novel; and having made themselves at home in this
upper story of their universe, they will find it amusing to deny that it
has a ground floor. The chance of conceiving, by these partial reversals
of science, a world composed entirely without troublesome machinery is
too tempting not to be taken up, whatever the ulterior risks; and
accordingly, when once psychological criticism is put in play, the
sphere of sense will be enlarged at the expense of the two rational
worlds, the material and the ideal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The rise of scepticism.</div>

<p>Consciousness, thus qualified by all the sensible qualities of things,
will exercise an irresistible attraction over the supernatural and ideal
realm, so that all the gods, all truths, and all ideals, as they have no
place among the sufficing causes of experience, will be identified with
decaying sensations. And presently those supposed causes themselves will
be retraced and drawn back into the immediate vortex, until the sceptic
has packed away nature, with all space and time, into the sphere of
sensuous <a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" />illusion, the distinguishing characteristic of which was that
it changed with the changes in the human body. The personal idealists
will declare that all body is a part of some body's mind. Thus, by a
curious reversion, the progress of reflection has led to hopeless
contradictions. Sense, which was discovered by observing the refraction
and intermittence to which appearances were subject, in seeming to be
quite different from what things were, now tries to subsist when the
things it was essentially contrasted with have been abolished. The
intellect becomes a Penelope, whose secret pleasure lies in undoing its
ostensible work; and science, becoming pensive, loves to relapse into
the dumb actuality and nerveless reverie from which it had once
extricated a world.</p>

<p>The occasion for this sophistication is worth noting; for if we follow
the thread which we have trailed behind us in entering the labyrinth we
shall be able at any moment to get out; especially as the omnivorous
monster lurking in its depths is altogether harmless. A moral and truly
transcendental critique of science, as of common sense, is never out of
place, since all such a critique does is to assign to each conception or
discovery its place and importance in the Life of Reason. So
administered, the critical cathartic will not prove a poison and will
not inhibit the cognitive function it was meant to purge. Every belief
will subsist that finds an empirical and logical warrant; while that a
belief is a belief and not a sensation <a name="Page_125" id="Page_125" />will not seem a ground for not
entertaining it, nor for subordinating it to some gratuitous assurance.
But a psychological criticism, if it is not critical of psychology
itself, and thinks to substitute a science of absolute sentience for
physics and dialectic, would rest on sophistry and end wholly in
bewilderment. The subject-matter of an absolute psychology would vanish
in its hands, since there is no sentience which is not at once the
effect of something physical and the appearance of something ideal. A
calculus of feelings, uninterpreted and referred to nothing ulterior,
would furnish no alternative system to substitute for the positive
sciences it was seeking to dislodge. In fact, those who call ordinary
objects unreal do not, on that account, find anything else to think
about. Their exorcism does not lay the ghost, and they are limited to
addressing it in uncivil language. It was not idly that reason in the
beginning excogitated a natural and an ideal world, a labour it might
well have avoided if appearance as it stands made a thinkable or a
practical universe.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_2" id="Footnote_A_2" /><a href="#FNanchor_A_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> The term &quot;matter&quot; (which ought before long to reappear in
philosophy) has two meanings. In popular science and theology it
commonly means a group of things in space, like the atoms of Democritus
or the human body and its members. Such matter plainly exists. Its
particles are concretions in existence like the planets; and if a given
hypothesis describing them turns out to be wrong, it is wrong only
because this matter exists so truly and in such discoverable guise that
the hypothesis in question may be shown to misrepresent its
constitution.
</p><p>
On the other hand, in Aristotle and in literary speech, matter means
something good to make other things out of. Here it is a concretion in
discourse, a dialectical term; being only an aspect or constituent of
every existence, it cannot exist by itself. A state of mind, like
everything not purely formal, has matter of this sort in it. Actual
love, for instance, differs <i>materially</i> from the mere idea or
possibility of love, which is all love would be if the matter or body of
it were removed. This matter is what idealists, bent on giving it a
grander name, call pure feeling, absolute consciousness, or metaphysical
will. These phrases are all used improperly to stand for the existence
or presence of things apart from their character, or for the mere strain
and dead weight of being. Matter is a far better term to use in the
premises, for it suggests the method as well as the fact of brute
existence. The surd in experience&mdash;its non-ideal element&mdash;is not an
indifferent vehicle for what it brings, as would be implied by calling
it pure feeling or absolute consciousness. Nor is it an act accepting or
rejecting objects, as would be implied by calling it will. In truth, the
surd conditions not merely the being of objects but their possible
quantity, the time and place of their appearance, and their degree of
perfection compared with the ideals they suggest. These important
factors in whatever exists are covered by the term matter and give it a
serious and indispensable r&ocirc;le in describing and feeling the world.
</p><p>
Aristotle, it may be added, did not adhere with perfect consistency to
the dialectical use of this word. Matter is sometimes used by him for
substance or for actual beings having both matter and form. The excuse
for this apparent lapse is, of course, that what taken by itself is a
piece of formed matter or an individual object may be regarded as mere
material for something else which it helps to constitute, as wheat is
matter for flour, and flour for bread. Thus the dialectical and
non-demonstrative use of the term to indicate one aspect of everything
could glide into its vulgar acceptation, to indicate one class of
things.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_3" id="Footnote_A_3" /><a href="#FNanchor_A_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> It has been suggested&mdash;what will not party spirit
contrive?&mdash;that these variations, called spontaneous by Darwin because
not predetermined by heredity, might be spontaneous in a metaphysical
sense, free acts with no material basis or cause whatsoever. Being free,
these acts might deflect evolution&mdash;like Descartes' soul acting on the
pineal gland&mdash;into wonderful new courses, prevent dissolution, and
gradually bring on the kingdom of Heaven, all as the necessary
implication of the latest science and the most atheistic philosophy. It
may not be needless to observe that if the variations were absolutely
free, <i>i.e.,</i> intrusions of pure chance, they would tend every which way
quite as much as if they were mechanically caused; while if they were
kept miraculously in line with some far-off divine event, they would not
be free at all, but would be due to metaphysical attraction and a magic
destiny prepared in the eternal; and so we should be brought round to
Aristotelian physics again.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_4" id="Footnote_A_4" /><a href="#FNanchor_A_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> The monads of Leibniz could justly be called minds, because
they had a dramatic destiny, and the most complex experience imaginable
was the state of but one monad, not an aggregate view or effect of a
multitude in fusion. But the recent improvements on that system take the
latter turn. Mind-stuff, or the material of mind, is supposed to be
contained in large quantities within any known feeling. Mind-stuff, we
are given to understand, is diffused in a medium corresponding to
apparent space (what else would a real space be?); it forms quantitative
aggregates, its transformations or aggregations are mechanically
governed, it endures when personal consciousness perishes, it is the
substance of bodies and, when duly organised, the potentiality of
thought. One might go far for a better description of matter. That any
material must be material might have been taken for an axiom; but our
idealists, in their eagerness to show that <i>Gefuehl ist Alles</i>, have
thought to do honour to feeling by forgetting that it is an expression
and wishing to make it a stuff.
</p><p>
There is a further circumstance showing that mind-stuff is but a bashful
name for matter. Mind-stuff, like matter, can be only an element in any
actual being. To make a thing or a thought out of mind-stuff you have to
rely on the <i>system</i> into which that material has fallen; the
substantive ingredients, from which an actual being borrows its
intensive quality, do not contain its individuating form. This form
depends on ideal relations subsisting between the ingredients, relations
which are not feelings but can be rendered only by propositions.</p></div>

<p style='text-align: center;'>PSYCHOLOGY</p>


<div class="sidenote">Mind reading not science.</div>

<p>If psychology is a science, many things that books of psychology contain
should be excluded from it. One is social imagination. Nature, besides
having a mechanical form and wearing a garment of sensible qualities,
makes a certain inner music in the beholder's mind, inciting him to
enter into other bodies and to fancy the new and profound life which he
might lead there. Who, as he watched a cat basking in the sun, has not
passed into that vigilant eye and felt all the leaps potential in that
luxurious torpor? Who has not attributed some little romance to the
passer-by? Who has not sometimes exchanged places even with things
inanimate, and drawn some new moral experience from following the
movement of stars or of daffodils? All this is idle musing or at best
poetry; yet our ordinary knowledge of what goes on in men's minds is
made of no other stuff. True, we have our own mind to go by, which
presumably might be a fair sample of what men's minds are; but
unfortunately our notion of ourselves is of all notions the most biassed
and idealistic. If <a name="Page_127" id="Page_127" />we attributed to other men only such obvious
reasoning, sound judgment, just preferences, honest passions, and
blameless errors as we discover in ourselves, we should take but an
insipid and impractical view of mankind.</p>

<p>In fact, we do far better: for what we impute to our fellow-men is
suggested by their conduct or by an instant imitation of their gesture
and expression. These manifestations, striking us in all their novelty
and alien habit, and affecting our interests in all manner of awkward
ways, create a notion of our friends' natures which is extremely vivid
and seldom extremely flattering.</p>

<p>Such romancing has the cogency proper to dramatic poetry; it is
persuasive only over the third person, who has never had, but has always
been about to have, the experience in question. Drawn from the potential
in one's self, it describes at best the possible in others. The thoughts
of men are incredibly evanescent, merely the foam of their labouring
natures; and they doubtless vary much more than our trite
classifications allow for. This is what makes passions and fashions,
religions and philosophies, so hard to conceive when once the trick of
them is a little antiquated. Languages are hardly more foreign to one
another than are the thoughts uttered in them. We should give men credit
for originality at least in their dreams, even if they have little of it
to show elsewhere; and as it was discovered but recently that all
memories are not furnished with <a name="Page_128" id="Page_128" />the like material images, but often
have no material images whatever, so it may have to be acknowledged that
the disparity in men's soliloquies is enormous, and that some races,
perhaps, live content without soliloquising at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experience a reconstruction.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, in describing what happens, or in enforcing a given view
of things, we constantly refer to universal experience as if everybody
was agreed about what universal experience is and had personally
gathered it all since the days of Adam. In fact, each man has only his
own, the remnant saved from his personal acquisitions. On the basis of
this his residual endowment, he has to conceive all nature, with
whatever experiences may have fallen there to the lot of others.
Universal experience is a comfortable fiction, a distinctly ideal
construction, and no fund available for any one to draw from; which of
course is not to deny that tradition and books, in transmitting
materially the work of other generations, tend to assimilate us also to
their mind. The result of their labours, in language, learning, and
institutions, forms a hothouse in which to force our seedling fancy to a
rational growth; but the influence is physical, the environment is
material, and its ideal background or significance has to be inferred by
us anew, according to our imaginative faculty and habits. Past
experience, apart from its monuments, is fled for ever out of mortal
reach. It is now a parcel of the motionless ether, <a name="Page_129" id="Page_129" />of the ineffectual
truth about what once was. To know it we must evoke it within ourselves,
starting from its inadequate expressions still extant in the world. This
reconstruction is highly speculative and, as Spinoza noted, better
evidence of what we are than of what other men have been.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The honest art of education.</div>

<p>When we appeal to general experience, then, what we really have to deal
with is our interlocutor's power of imagining that experience; for the
real experience is dead and ascended into heaven, where it can neither
answer nor hear. Our agreements or divergences in this region do not
touch science; they concern only friendship and unanimity. All our
proofs are, as they say in Spain, pure conversation; and as the purpose
and best result can be only to kindle intelligence and propagate an
ideal art, the method should be Socratic, genial, literary. In these
matters, the alternative to imagination is not science but sophistry. We
may perhaps entangle our friends in their own words, and force them for
the moment to say what they do not mean, and what it is not in their
natures to think; but the bent bow will spring back, perhaps somewhat
sharply, and we shall get little thanks for our labour. There would be
more profit in taking one another frankly by the hand and walking
together along the outskirts of real knowledge, pointing to the material
facts which we all can see, nature, the monuments, the texts, the actual
ways and institutions of men; and in <a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" />the presence of such a stimulus,
with the contagion of a common interest, the plastic mind would respond
of itself to the situation, and we should be helping one another to
understand whatever lies within the range of our fancy, be it in
antiquity or in the human heart. That would be a true education; and
while the result could not possibly be a science, not even a science of
people's states of mind, it would be a deepening of humanity in
ourselves and a wholesome knowledge of our ignorance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arbitrary readings of the mind.</div>

<p>In what is called psychology this loose, imaginative method is often
pursued, although the field covered may be far narrower. Any generic
experience of which a writer pretends to give an exact account must be
reconstructed <i>ad hoc</i>; it is not the experience that necessitates the
description, but the description that recalls the experience, defining
it in a novel way. When La Rochefoucauld says, for instance, that there
is something about our friend's troubles that secretly pleases us, many
circumstances in our own lives, or in other people's, may suddenly recur
to us to illustrate that <i>aper&ccedil;u</i>; and we may be tempted to say, There
is a truth. But is it a scientific truth? Or is it merely a bit of
satire, a ray from a literary flashlight, giving a partial clearness for
a moment to certain jumbled memories? If the next day we open a volume
of Adam Smith, and read that man is naturally benevolent, that he cannot
but enact <a name="Page_131" id="Page_131" />and share the vicissitudes of his fellow-creatures, and that
another man's imminent danger or visible torment will cause in him a
distress little inferior to that felt by the unfortunate sufferer, we
shall probably think this a truth also, and a more normal and a
profounder truth than the other. But is it a law? Is it a scientific
discovery that can lead us to definite inferences about what will happen
or help us to decompose a single event, accurately and without
ambiguity, into its component forces? Not only is such a thing
impossible, but the Scotch philosopher's amiable generalities, perhaps
largely applicable to himself and to his friends of the eighteenth
century, may fail altogether to fit an earlier or a later age; and every
new shade of brute born into the world will ground a new &quot;theory of the
moral sentiments.&quot;</p>

<p>The whole cogency of such psychology, therefore, lies in the ease with
which the hearer, on listening to the analysis, recasts something in his
own past after that fashion. These endless rival apperceptions regard
facts that, until they are referred to their mechanical ground, show no
continuity and no precision in their march. The apperception of them,
consequently, must be doubly arbitrary and unstable, for there is no
method in the subject-matter and there is less in the treatment of it.
The views, however, are far from equal in value. Some may be more
natural, eloquent, enlightening, than others; they may serve better the
essential purpose of reflection, <a name="Page_132" id="Page_132" />which is to pick out and bring forward
continually out of the past what can have a value for the present. The
spiritual life in which this value lies is practical in its
associations, because it understands and dominates what touches action;
yet it is contemplative in essence, since successful action consists in
knowing what you are attempting and in attempting what you can find
yourself achieving. Plan and performance will alike appeal to
imagination and be appreciated through it; so that what trains
imagination refines the very stuff that life is made of. Science is
instrumental in comparison, since the chief advantage that comes of
knowing accurately is to be able, with safety, to imagine freely. But
when it is science and accurate knowledge that we pursue, we should not
be satisfied with literature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Human nature appealed to rather than described.</div>

<p>When discourse on any subject would be persuasive, it appeals to the
interlocutor to think in a certain dynamic fashion, inciting him, not
without leading questions, to give shape to his own sentiments.
Knowledge of the soul, insight into human nature and experience, are no
doubt requisite in such an exercise; yet this insight is in these cases
a vehicle only, an instinctive method, while the result aimed at is
agreement on some further matter, conviction and enthusiasm, rather than
psychological information. Thus if I declare that the storms of winter
are not so unkind as benefits forgot, I say something which if true <a name="Page_133" id="Page_133" />has
a certain psychological value, for it could be inferred from that
assertion that resentment is generally not proportionate to the injury
received but rather to the surprise caused, so that it springs from our
own foolishness more than from other people's bad conduct. Yet my
observation was not made in the interest of any such inferences: it was
made to express an emotion of my own, in hopes of kindling in others a
similar emotion. It was a judgment which others were invited to share.
There was as little exact science about it as if I had turned it into
frank poetry and exclaimed, &quot;Blow, blow, thou winter's wind!&quot; Knowledge
of human nature might be drawn even from that apostrophe, and a very
fine shade of human feeling is surely expressed in it, as Shakespeare
utters it; but to pray or to converse is not for that reason the same
thing as to pursue science.</p>

<p>Now it constantly happens in philosophic writing that what is supposed
to go on in the human mind is described and appealed to in order to
support some observation or illustrate some argument&mdash;as continually,
for instance, in the older English critics of human nature, or in these
very pages. What is offered in such cases is merely an invitation to
think after a certain fashion. A way of grasping or interpreting some
fact is suggested, with a more or less civil challenge to the reader to
resist the suasion of his own experience so evoked and represented. Such
a method of <a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" />appeal may be called psychological, in the sense that it
relies for success on the total movement of the reader's life and mind,
without forcing a detailed assent through ocular demonstration or pure
dialectic; but the psychology of it is a method and a resource rather
than a doctrine. The only doctrine aimed at in such philosophy is a
general reasonableness, a habit of thinking straight from the elements
of experience to its ultimate and stable deliverance. This is what in
his way a poet or a novelist would do. Fiction swarms with such sketches
of human nature and such renderings of the human mind as a critical
philosopher depends upon for his construction. He need not be interested
in the pathology of individuals nor even in the natural history of man;
his effort is wholly directed toward improving the mind's economy and
infusing reason into it as one might religion, not without diligent
self-examination and a public confession of sin. The human mind is
nobody's mind in particular, and the science of it is necessarily
imaginative. No one can pretend in philosophic discussion any more than
in poetry that the experience described is more than typical. It is
given out not for a literal fact, existing in particular moments or
persons, but for an imaginative expression of what nature and life have
impressed on the speaker. In so far as others live in the same world
they may recognise the experience so expressed by him and adopt his
interpretation; but the aptness of his <a name="Page_135" id="Page_135" />descriptions and analyses will
not constitute a science of mental states, but rather&mdash;what is a far
greater thing&mdash;the art of stimulating and consolidating reflection in
general.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dialectic in psychology.</div>

<p>There is a second constituent of current psychology which is indeed a
science, but not a science of matters of fact&mdash;I mean the dialectic of
ideas. The character of father, for example, implies a son, and this
relation, involved in the ideas both of son and of father, implies
further that a transmitted essence or human nature is shared by both.
Every idea, if its logical texture is reflected upon, will open out into
a curious world constituted by distinguishing the constituents of that
idea more clearly and making explicit its implicit structure and
relations. When an idea has practical intent and is a desire, its
dialectic is even more remarkable. If I love a man I thereby love all
those who share whatever makes me love him, and I thereby hate whatever
tends to deprive him of this excellence. If it should happen, however,
that those who resembled him most in amiability&mdash;say by flattering me no
less than he did&mdash;were precisely his mortal enemies, the logic of my
affections would become somewhat involved. I might end either by
striving to reconcile the rivals or by discovering that what I loved was
not the man at all, but only an office exercised by him in my regard
which any one else might also exercise.</p>

<p>These inner lucubrations, however, while they <a name="Page_136" id="Page_136" />lengthen the moment's
vista and deepen present intent, give no indication whatever about the
order or distribution of actual feelings. They are out of place in a
psychology that means to be an account of what happens in the world. For
these dialectical implications do not actually work themselves out. They
have no historical or dynamic value. The man that by mistake or courtesy
I call a father may really have no son, any more than Herodotus for
being the father of history; or having had a son, he may have lost him;
or the creature sprung from his loins may be a misshapen idiot, having
nothing ideal in common with his parent. Similarly my affection for a
friend, having causes much deeper than discourse, may cling to him
through all transformations in his qualities and in his attitude toward
me; and it may never pass to others for resembling him, nor take, in all
its days, a Platonic direction. The impulse on which that dialectic was
based may exhaust its physical energy, and all its implications may be
nipped in the bud and be condemned for ever to the limbo of things
unborn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spinoza on the passions.</div>

<p>Spinoza's account of the passions is a beautiful example of dialectical
psychology, beautiful because it shows so clearly the possibilities and
impossibilities in such a method. Spinoza began with self-preservation,
which was to be the principle of life and the root of all feelings. The
violence done to physics appears in this beginning. Self-preservation,
taken <a name="Page_137" id="Page_137" />strictly, is a principle not illustrated in nature, where
everything is in flux, and where habits destructive or dangerous to the
body are as conspicuous as protective instincts. Physical mechanism
requires reproduction, which implies death, and it admits suicide.
Spinoza himself, far too noble a mind to be fixed solely on preserving
its own existence, was compelled to give self-preservation an
extravagant meaning in order to identify it with &quot;intellectual love of
God&quot; or the happy contemplation of that natural law which destroyed all
individuals. To find the self-preserving man you must take him after he
has ceased to grow and before he has begun to love. Self-preservation,
being thus no principle of natural history, the facts or estimations
classed under that head need to be referred instead to one of two other
principles&mdash;either to mechanical equilibrium and habit, or to
dialectical consistency in judgment.</p>

<p>Self-preservation might express, perhaps, the values which conceived
events acquire in respect to a given attitude of will, to an arrested
momentary ideal. The actual state of any animal, his given instincts and
tensions, are undoubtedly the point of origin from which all changes and
relations are morally estimated; and if this attitude is afterward
itself subjected to estimation, that occurs by virtue of its affinity or
conflict with the living will of another moment. Valuation is
dialectical, not descriptive, nor contemplative of a natural process. It
might accordingly be devel<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138" />oped by seeing what is implied in the
self-preservation, or rather expression, of a will which by that
dialectic would discover its ideal scope.</p>

<p>Such a principle, however, could never explain the lapse of that
attitude itself. A natural process cannot be governed by the ideal
relations which conceived things acquire by being represented in one of
its moments. Spinoza, however, let himself wander into this path and
made the semblance of an attempt, indeed not very deceptive, to trace
the sequence of feelings by their mutual implication. The changes in
life were to be explained by what the crystallised posture of life might
be at a single instant. The arrow's flight was to be deduced from its
instantaneous position. A passion's history was to be the history of
what would have been its expression if it had had no history at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A principle of estimation cannot govern events.</div>

<p>A man suffered by destiny to maintain for ever a single unchanged
emotion might indeed think out its multifarious implications much in
Spinoza's way. It is in that fashion that parties and sects, when
somewhat stable, come to define their affinities and to know their
friends and enemies all over the universe of discourse. Suppose, for
instance, that I feel some titillation on reading a proposition
concerning the contrast between Paul's idea of Peter and Peter's idea of
himself, a titillation which is accompanied by the idea of Spinoza, its
external cause. Now he who loves an effect <a name="Page_139" id="Page_139" />must proportionately love
its cause, and titillation accompanied by the idea of its external cause
is, Spinoza has proved, what men call love. I therefore find that I love
Spinoza. Having got so far, I may consider further, referring to another
demonstration in the book, that if some one gives Spinoza joy&mdash;Hobbes,
for instance&mdash;my delight in Spinoza's increased perfection, consequent
upon his joy and my love of him, accompanied by the idea of Hobbes, its
external cause, constitutes love on my part for the redoubtable Hobbes
as well. Thus the periphery of my affections may expand indefinitely,
till it includes the infinite, the ultimate external cause of all my
titillations. But how these interesting discoveries are interrupted
before long by a desire for food, or by an indomitable sense that Hobbes
and the infinite are things I do <i>not</i> love, is something that my
dialectic cannot deduce; for it was the values radiating from a given
impulse, the implications of its instant object, that were being
explicated, not at all the natural forces that carry a man through that
impulse and beyond it to the next phase of his dream, a phase which if
it continues the former episode must continue it spontaneously, by grace
of mechanical forces.</p>

<p>When dialectic is thus introduced into psychology, an intensive
knowledge of the heart is given out for distributive knowledge of
events. Such a study, when made by a man of genius, may furnish good
spiritual reading, for it will reveal what <a name="Page_140" id="Page_140" />our passions mean and what
sentiments they would lead to if they could remain fixed and dictate all
further action. This insight may make us aware of strange
inconsistencies in our souls, and seeing how contrary some of our ideals
are to others and how horrible, in some cases, would be their ultimate
expression, we may be shocked into setting our house in order; and in
trying to understand ourselves we may actually develop a self that can
be understood. Meantime this inner discipline will not enlighten us
about the march of affairs. It will not give us a key to evolution,
either in ourselves or in others. Even while we refine our aspirations,
the ground they sprang from will be eaten away beneath our feet. Instead
of developing yesterday's passion, to-day may breed quite another in its
place; and if, having grown old and set in our mental posture, we are
incapable of assuming another, and are condemned to carrying on the
dialectic of our early visions into a new-born world, to be a
schoolmaster's measuring-rod for life's infinite exuberance, we shall
find ourselves at once in a foreign country, speaking a language that
nobody understands. No destiny is more melancholy than that of the
dialectical prophet, who makes more rigid and tyrannous every day a
message which every day grows less applicable and less significant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scientific psychology a part of biology.</div>

<p>That remaining portion of psychology which is a science, and a science
of matters of fact, is physiological; it belongs to natural history and
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141" />constitutes the biology of man. Soul, which was not originally
distinguished from life, is there studied in its natural operation in
the body and in the world. Psychology then remains what it was in
Aristotle's <i>De Anima</i>&mdash;an ill-developed branch of natural science,
pieced out with literary terms and perhaps enriched by occasional
dramatic interpretations. The specifically mental or psychic element
consists in the feeling which accompanies bodily states and natural
situations. This feeling is discovered and distributed at the same time
that bodies and other material objects are defined; for when a man
begins to decipher permanent and real things, and to understand that
they are merely material, he thereby sets apart, in contrast with such
external objects, those images and emotions which can no longer enter
into the things' texture. The images and emotions remain, however,
attached to those things, for they are refractions of them through
bodily organs, or effects of their presence on the will, or passions
fixed upon them as their object.</p>

<p>In parts of biology which do not deal with man observers do not hesitate
to refer in the same way to the pain, the desire, the intention, which
they may occasionally read in an animal's aspect. Darwin, for instance,
constantly uses psychical language: his birds love one another's plumage
and their &aelig;sthetic charms are factors in natural selection. Such little
fables do not detract from the <a name="Page_142" id="Page_142" />scientific value of Darwin's
observations, because we see at once what the fables mean. The
description keeps close enough to the facts observed for the reader to
stop at the latter, rather than at the language in which they are
stated. In the natural history of man such interpretation into mental
terms, such microscopic romance, is even easier and more legitimate,
because language allows people, perhaps before their feelings are long
past, to describe them in terms which are understood to refer directly
to mental experience. The sign's familiarity, to be sure, often hides in
these cases a great vagueness and unseizableness in the facts; yet a
beginning in defining distinctly the mental phase of natural situations
has been made in those small autobiographies which introspective writers
sometimes compose, or which are taken down in hospitals and laboratories
from the lips of &quot;subjects.&quot; What a man under special conditions may say
he feels or thinks adds a constituent phase to his natural history; and
were these reports exact and extended enough, it would become possible
to enumerate the precise sensations and ideas which accompany every
state of body and every social situation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confused attempt to detach the psychic element.</div>

<p>This advantage, however, is the source of that confusion and sophistry
which distinguish the biology of man from the rest of physics. Attention
is there arrested at the mental term, in forgetfulness of the situation
which gave it warrant, <a name="Page_143" id="Page_143" />and an invisible world, composed of these
imagined experiences, begins to stalk behind nature and may even be
thought to exist independently. This metaphysical dream may be said to
have two stages: the systematic one, which is called idealism, and an
incidental one which pervades ordinary psychology, in so far as mental
facts are uprooted from their basis and deprived of their expressive or
spiritual character, in order to be made elements in a dynamic scheme.
This battle of feelings, whether with atoms or exclusively with their
own cohorts, might be called a primitive materialism, rather than an
idealism, if idealism were to retain its Platonic sense; for forms and
realisations are taken in this system for substantial elements, and are
made to figure either as a part or as the whole of the world's matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Differentia of the psychic.</div>

<p>Phenomena specifically mental certainly exist, since natural phenomena
and ideal truths are concentrated and telescoped in apprehension,
besides being weighted with an emotion due to their effect on the person
who perceives them. This variation, which reality suffers in being
reported to perception, turns the report into a mental fact
distinguishable from its subject-matter. When the flux is partly
understood and the natural world has become a constant presence, the
whole flux itself, as it flowed originally, comes to be called a mental
flux, because its elements and method are seen to <a name="Page_144" id="Page_144" />differ from the
elements and method embodied in material objects or in ideal truth. The
primitive phenomena are now called mental because they all deviate from
the realities to be ultimately conceived. To call the immediate mental
is therefore correct and inevitable when once the ultimate is in view;
but if the immediate were all, to call it mental would be unmeaning.</p>

<p>The visual image of a die, for instance, has at most three faces, none
of them quite square; no hired artificer is needed to produce it; it
cannot be found anywhere nor shaken in any box; it lasts only for an
instant; thereafter it disappears without a trace&mdash;unless it flits back
unaccountably through the memory&mdash;and it leaves no ponderable dust or
ashes to attest that it had a substance. The opposite of all this is
true of the die itself. But were no material die in existence, the image
itself would be material; for, however evanescent, it would occupy
space, have geometrical shape, colour, and magic dynamic destinies. Its
transformations as it rolled on the idea of a table would be
transformations in nature, however unaccountable by any steady law. Such
material qualities a mental fact can retain only in the spiritual form
of representation. A representation of matter is immaterial, but a
material image, when no object exists, is a material fact. If the
Absolute, to take an ultimate case, perceived nothing but space and
atoms (perceiving itself, if you will, therein), space and atoms would
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145" />be its whole nature, and it would constitute a perfect materialism. The
fact that materialism was true would not of itself constitute an
idealism worth distinguishing from its opposite. For a vehicle or locus
exists only when it makes some difference to the thing it carries,
presenting it in a manner not essential to its own nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Approach to irrelevant sentience.</div>

<p>The qualification of being by the mental medium may be carried to any
length. As the subject-matter recedes the mental datum ceases to have
much similarity or inward relevance to what is its cause or its meaning.
The report may ultimately become, like pure pain or pleasure, almost
wholly blind and irrelevant to any world; yet such emotion is none the
less immersed in matter and dependent on natural changes both for its
origin and for its function, since a significant pleasure or pain makes
comments on the world and involves ideals about what ought to be
happening there.</p>

<p>Mental facts synchronise with their basis, for no thought hovers over a
dead brain and there is no vision in a dark chamber; but their tenure of
life is independent of that of their objects, since thought may be
prophetic or reminiscent and is intermittent even when its object enjoys
a continuous existence. Mental facts are similar to their objects, since
things and images have, intrinsically regarded, the same constitution;
but images do not move in the same plane with things and their parts are
in no proportionate dynamic <a name="Page_146" id="Page_146" />relation to the parts of the latter.
Thought's place in nature is exiguous, however broad the landscape it
represents; it touches the world tangentially only, in some ferment of
the brain. It is probably no atom that supports the soul (as Leibnitz
imagined), but rather some cloud of atoms shaping or remodelling an
organism. Mind in this case would be, in its physical relation to
matter, what it feels itself to be in its moral attitude toward the
same; a witness to matter's interesting aspects and a realisation of its
forms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perception represents things in their practical relation to
the body.</div>

<p>Mental facts, moreover, are highly selective; especially does this
appear in respect to the dialectical world, which is in itself infinite,
while the sum of human logic and mathematics, though too long for most
men's patience, is decidedly brief. If we ask ourselves on what
principle this selection and foreshortening of truth takes place in the
mind, we may perhaps come upon the real bond and the deepest contrast
between mind and its environment. The infinity of formal truth is
disregarded in human thought when it is irrelevant to practice and to
happiness; the infinity of nature is represented there in violent
perspective, centring about the body and its interests. The seat and
starting-point of every mental survey is a brief animal life. A mind
seems, then, to be a consciousness of the body's interests, expressed in
terms of what affects that body, as if in the Babel <a name="Page_147" id="Page_147" />of nature a man
heard only the voices that pronounced his name. A mind is a private
view; it is gathered together in proportion as physical sensibility
extends its range and makes one stretch of being after another tributary
to the animal's life, and in proportion also as this sensibility is
integrated, so that every organ in its reaction enlists the resources of
every other organ as well. A personal will and intelligence thus arise;
and they direct action from within with a force and freedom which are
exactly proportionate to the material forces, within and without the
body, which the soul has come to represent.</p>

<p>In other words, mind raises to an actual existence that <i>form</i> in
material processes which, had the processes remained wholly material,
would have had only ideal or imputed being&mdash;as the stars would not have
been divided into the signs of the Zodiac but for the fanciful eye of
astrologers. Automata might arise and be destroyed without any value
coming or going; only a form-loving observer could say that anything
fortunate or tragic had occurred, as poets might at the budding or
withering of a flower. Some of nature's automata, however, love
themselves, and comment on the form they achieve or abandon; these
constellations of atoms are genuine beasts. Their consciousness and
their interest in their own individuality rescues that individuality
from the realm of discourse and from having merely imputed limits.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148" />Mind the existence in which form becomes actual.</div>

<p>That the basis of mind lies in the body's interests rather than in its
atoms may seem a doctrine somewhat too poetical for psychology; yet may
not poetry, superposed on material existence and supported by it, be
perhaps the key to mind? Such a view hangs well together with the
practical and prospective character of consciousness, with its total
dependence on the body, its cognitive relevance to the world, and its
formal disparity from material being. Mind does not accompany body like
a useless and persistent shadow; it is significant and it is
intermittent. Much less can it be a link in physiological processes,
processes irrelevant to its intent and incompatible with its immaterial
essence. Consciousness seems to arise when the body assumes an attitude
which, being an attitude, supervenes upon the body's elements and cannot
be contained within them. This attitude belongs to the whole body in its
significant operation, and the report of this attitude, its expression,
requires survey, synthesis, appreciation&mdash;things which constitute what
we call mentality. This remains, of course, the mentality of that
material situation; it is the voice of that particular body in that
particular pass. The mind therefore represents its basis, but this basis
(being a <i>form</i> of material existence and not matter itself) is neither
vainly reduplicated by representation nor used up materially in the
process.</p>

<p>Representation is far from idle, since it brings <a name="Page_149" id="Page_149" />to focus those
mechanical unities which otherwise would have existed only potentially
and at the option of a roving eye. In evoking consciousness nature makes
this delimination real and unambiguous; there are henceforth actual
centres and actual interests in the mechanical flux. The flux continues
to be mechanical, but the representation of it supervening has created
values which, being due to imputation, could not exist without being
imputed, while at the same time they could not have been imputed without
being attached to one object or event rather than to another. Material
dramas are thus made moral and raised to an existence of their own by
being expressed in what we call the souls of animals and men; a mind is
the entelechy of an organic body.<a name="FNanchor_A_5" id="FNanchor_A_5" /><a href="#Footnote_A_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> It is a region where form breeds an
existence to express it, and destiny becomes important by being felt.
Mind adds to being a new and needful witness so soon as the constitution
of being gives foothold to apperception of its movement, and offers
something in which it is possible to ground an interest.</p>

<p>That Aristotle has not been generally followed in views essentially so
natural and pregnant as these is due no doubt to want of thoroughness in
conceiving them, not only on the part of his read<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150" />ers but even on his
own part; for he treated the soul, which should be on his own theory
only an expression and an unmoved mover, as a power and an efficient
cause. Analysis had not gone far enough in his day to make evident that
all dynamic principles are mechanical and that mechanism can obtain only
among objects; but by this time it should no longer seem doubtful that
mental facts can have no connection except through their material basis
and no mutual relevance except through their objects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt at idealistic physics.</div>

<p>There is indeed a strange half-assumption afloat, a sort of reserved
faith which every one seems to respect but nobody utters, to the effect
that the mental world has a mechanism of its own, and that ideas
intelligently produce and sustain one another. Systematic idealists, to
be sure, have generally given a dialectical or moral texture to the
cosmos, so that the passage from idea to idea in experience need not be
due, in their physics, to any intrinsic or proportionate efficacy in
these ideas themselves. The march of experience is not explained at all
by such high cosmogonies. They abandon that practical calculation to
some science of illusion that has to be tolerated in this provisional
life. Their own understanding is of things merely in the gross, because
they fall in with some divine plan and produce, unaccountably enough,
some interesting harmony. Empirical idealists, on the contrary, in
making a metaphysics out of <a name="Page_151" id="Page_151" />psychology, hardly know what they do. The
laws of experience which they refer to are all laws of physics. It is
only the &quot;possibilities&quot; of sensation that stand and change according to
law; the sensations themselves, if not referred to those permanent
possibilities, would be a chaos worse than any dream.</p>

<p>Correct and scrupulous as empiricism may be when it turns its face
backward and looks for the seat, the criterion, and the elements of
knowledge, it is altogether incoherent and self-inhibited when it looks
forward. It can believe in nothing but in what it conceives, if it would
rise at all above a stupid immersion in the immediate; yet the relations
which attach the moments of feeling together are material relations,
implying the whole frame of nature. Psychology can accordingly conceive
nothing but the natural world, with its diffuse animation, since this is
the only background that the facts suggest or that, in practice, anybody
can think of. If empiricism trusted the intellect, and consented to
immerse flying experience in experience understood, it would become
ordinary science and ordinary common sense. Deprecating this result, for
no very obvious reason, it has to balance itself on the thin edge of an
unwilling materialism, with a continual protestation that it does not
believe in anything that it thinks. It is wholly entangled in the
prevalent sophism that a man must renounce a belief when he discovers
how he has formed it, and that <a name="Page_152" id="Page_152" />our ancestors&mdash;at least the remoter
ones&mdash;begin to exist when we discover them.</p>

<p>When Descartes, having composed a mechanical system of the world, was
asked by admiring ladies to say something about the passions, what came
into his mind was characteristically simple and dialectical. Life, he
thought, was a perpetual conflict between reason and the emotions. The
soul had its own natural principle to live by, but was diverted from
that rational path by the waves of passion that beat against it and
sometimes flooded it over. That was all his psychology. Ideal entities
in dramatic relations, in a theatre which had to be borrowed, of course,
from the other half of the world; because while a material mechanism
might be conceived without minds in it, minds in action could not be
conceived without a material mechanism&mdash;at least a represented
one&mdash;lying beneath and between. Spinoza made a great improvement in the
system by attaching the mind more systematically to the body, and
studying the parts which organ and object played in qualifying
knowledge; but his conception of mental unities and mental processes
remained literary, or at best, as we have seen, dialectical. No shadow
of a principle at once psychic and genetic appeared in his philosophy.
All mind was still a transcript of material facts or a deepening of
moral relations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Association not efficient</div>

<p>The idea of explaining the flow of ideas without reference to bodies
appeared, however, in the <a name="Page_153" id="Page_153" />principle of association. This is the nearest
approach that has yet been made to a physics of disembodied
mind&mdash;something which idealism sadly needs to develop. A terrible
incapacity, however, appears at once in the principle of association;
for even if we suppose that it could account for the flow of ideas, it
does not pretend to supply any basis for sensations. And as the more
efficient part of association&mdash;association by contiguity&mdash;is only a
repetition in ideas of the order once present in impressions, the whole
question about the march of mental experience goes back to what
association does not touch, namely, the origin of sensations. What
everybody assumed, of course, was that the order and quality of
sensations were due to the body; but their derivation was not studied.
Hume ignored it as much as possible, and Berkeley did not sacrifice a
great deal when he frankly suggested that the production of sensation
must be the direct work of God.</p>

<p>This tendency not to recognise the material conditions of mind showed
itself more boldly in the treatment of ideation. We are not plainly
aware (in spite of headaches, fatigue, sleep, love, intoxication, and
madness) that the course of our thoughts is as directly dependent on the
body as is their inception. It was therefore possible, without glaring
paradox, to speak as if ideas caused one another. They followed, in
recurring, the order they had first had in experience, as when we <a name="Page_154" id="Page_154" />learn
something by heart. Why, a previous verse being given, we should
sometimes be unable to repeat the one that had often followed it before,
there was no attempt to explain: it sufficed that reverie often seemed
to retrace events in their temporal order. Even less dependent on
material causes seemed to be the other sort of association, association
by similarity. This was a feat for the wit and the poet, to jump from
China to Peru, by virtue of some spark of likeness that might flash out
between them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It describes coincidences.</div>

<p>Much natural history has been written and studied with the idea of
finding curious facts. The demand has not been for constant laws or
intelligibility, but for any circumstance that could arrest attention or
divert the fancy. In this spirit, doubtless, instances of association
were gathered and classified. It was the young ladies' botany of mind.
Under association could be gathered a thousand interesting anecdotes, a
thousand choice patterns of thought. Talk of the wars, says Hobbes, once
led a man to ask what was the value of a Roman penny. But why only once?
The wars must have been often mentioned when the delivering up of King
Charles did not enter any mind; and when it did, this would not have led
any one to think of Judas and the thirty pence, unless he had been a
good royalist and a good Christian&mdash;and then only by a curious accident.
It was not these ideas, then, in their natural capacity that suggested
one another; <a name="Page_155" id="Page_155" />but some medium in which they worked, once in the world,
opened those particular avenues between them. Nevertheless, no one cared
to observe that each fact had had many others, never recalled,
associated with it as closely as those which were remembered. Nor was
the matter taken so seriously that one needed to ask how, among all
similar things, similarity could decide which should be chosen; nor how
among a thousand contiguous facts one rather than another should be
recalled for contiguity's sake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Understanding is based on instinct and expressed in
dialectic.</div>

<p>The best instance, perhaps, of regular association might be found in
language and its meaning; for understanding implies that each word
habitually calls up its former associates. Yet in what, psychologically
considered, does understanding a word consist? What concomitants does
the word &quot;horse&quot; involve in actual sentience? Hardly a clear image such
as a man might paint; for the name is not confined to recalling one view
of one animal obtained at one moment. Perhaps all that recurs is a vague
sense of the environment, in nature and in discourse, in which that
object lies. The word &quot;kite&quot; would immediately make a different region
warm in the world through which the mind was groping. One would turn in
idea to the sky rather than to the ground, and feel suggestions of a
more buoyant sort of locomotion.</p>

<p>Understanding has to be described in terms of its potential outcome,
since the incandescent proc<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156" />ess itself, as it exists in transit, will
not suffer stable terms to define it. Potentiality is something which
each half of reality reproaches the other with; things are potential to
feeling because they are not life, and feelings are potential to science
because they elude definition. To understand, therefore, is to know what
to do and what to say in the sign's presence; and this practical
knowledge is far deeper than any echo casually awakened in fancy at the
same time. Instinctive recognition has those echoes for the most
superficial part of its effect. Because I understand what &quot;horse&quot; means,
the word can make me recall some episode in which a horse once figured.
This understanding is instinctive and practical and, if the phrase may
be pardoned, it is the body that understands. It is the body, namely,
that contains the habit and readiness on which understanding hangs; and
the sense of understanding, the instant rejection of whatever clashes
and makes nonsense in that context, is but a transcript of the body's
education. Actual mind is all above board; it is all speculative,
vibrant, the fruit and gift of those menial subterranean processes. Some
generative processes may be called psychic in that they minister to mind
and lend it what little continuity it can boast of; but they are not
processes in consciousness. Processes in consciousness are &aelig;sthetic or
dialectical processes, focussing a form rather than ushering in an
existence. Mental activity has a character altogether alien to
association: it <a name="Page_157" id="Page_157" />is spiritual, not mechanical; an entelechy, not a
genesis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suggestion a fancy name for automatism,</div>

<p>For these and other reasons association has fallen into some disrepute;
but it is not easy to say what, in absolute psychology, has come to take
its place. If we speak of suggestion, a certain dynamic turn seems to be
given to the matter; yet in what sense a perception suggests its future
development remains a mystery. That a certain ripening and expansion of
consciousness goes on in man, not guided by former collocations of
ideas, is very true; for we do not fall in love for the first time
because this person loved and these ardent emotions have been habitually
associated in past experience. And any impassioned discourse, opening at
every turn into new vistas, shows the same sort of vegetation. Yet to
observe that consciousness is automatic is not to disclose the mechanism
by which it evolves. The theory of spontaneous growth offers less
explanation of events, if that be possible, than the theory of
association. It is perhaps a better description of the facts, since at
least it makes no attempt to deduce them from one another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and will another.</div>

<p>If, on the contrary, a relation implied in the burden or will of the
moment be invoked, the connection established, so far as it goes, is
dialectical. Where a dialectical correspondence is not found, a material
cause would have to be appealed to, Such a half-dialectical <a name="Page_158" id="Page_158" />psychology
would be like Schopenhauer's, quite metaphysical. It might be a great
improvement on an absolute psychology, because it would restore, even if
in mythical terms, a background and meaning to life. The unconscious
Absolute Will, the avid Genius of the Species, the all-attracting
Platonic Ideas are fabulous; but beneath them it is not hard to divine
the forces of nature. This volitional school supplies a good
stepping-stone from metaphysics back to scientific psychology. It
remains merely to substitute instinct for will, and to explain that
instinct&mdash;or even will, if the term be thought more consoling&mdash;is merely
a word covering that operative organisation in the body which controls
action, determines affinities, dictates preferences, and sustains
ideation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Double attachment of mind to nature.</div>

<p>What scientific psychology has to attempt&mdash;for little has been
accomplished&mdash;may be reduced to this: To develop physiology and
anthropology until the mechanism of life becomes clear, at least in its
general method, and then to determine, by experiment and by well-sifted
testimony, what conscious sublimation each of those material situations
attains, if indeed it attains any. There will always remain, no doubt,
many a region where the machinery of nature is too fine for us to trace
or eludes us by involving agencies that we lack senses to perceive. In
these regions where science is denied we shall have to be satisfied with
landscape-painting. The more obvious results <a name="Page_159" id="Page_159" />and superficial harmonies
perceived in those regions will receive names and physics will be
arrested at natural history. Where these unexplained facts are mental it
will not be hard to do more systematically what common sense has done
already, and to attach them, as we attach love or patriotism, to the
natural crises that subtend them.</p>

<p>This placing of mental facts is made easy by the mental facts
themselves, since the connection of mind with nature is double, and even
when the derivation of a feeling is obscure we have but to study its
meaning, allowing it to tell us what it is interested in, for a
roundabout path to lead us safely back to its natural basis. It is
superfluous to ask a third person what circumstances produce hunger:
hunger will lead you unmistakably enough to its point of origin, and its
extreme interest in food will not suffer you long to believe that want
of nourishment has nothing to do with its cause. And it is not otherwise
with higher emotions and ideas. Nothing but sophistry can put us in
doubt about what conscience represents; for conscience does not say,
square the circle, extinguish mankind so as to stop its sufferings, or
steal so as to benefit your heirs. It says, Thou shalt not kill, and it
also says, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God who brought thee out of
the land of Egypt. So that conscience, by its import and incidence,
clearly enough declares what it springs from&mdash;a social tradition; and
what it represents&mdash;the interests, <a name="Page_160" id="Page_160" />real or imaginary, of the community
in which you were reared.</p>

<p>Where psychology depends on literature, where both its units and its
method are poetical, there can be no talk of science. We may as justly,
or as absurdly, speak of the spirit of an age or of a religion as of a
man's character or a river's god. Particulars in illustration may have
good historic warrant, but the unities superimposed are ideal. Such
metaphors may be very useful, for a man may ordinarily be trusted to
continue his practices and a river its beneficent or disastrous floods;
and since those rhetorical forms have no existence in nature we may
continue to frame them as may be most convenient for discourse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is the subject-matter of psychology absolute being?</div>

<p>When psychology is a science, then, it describes the flying
consciousness that accompanies bodily life. It is the science of feeling
or absolute appearance, taken exactly as it seems or feels. Does such a
psychology, we may be tempted to ask, constitute scientific knowledge of
reality? Is it at last the true metaphysics? This question would have to
be answered in the negative, yet not without some previous
discriminations. There is honesty in the conviction that sentience is a
sort of absolute; it is something which certainly exists. The first
Cartesian axiom applies to it, and to feel, even doubtfully, that
feeling existed would be to posit its existence. The science that
describes sentience describes at least a part of ex<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161" />istence. Yet this
self-grounding of consciousness is a suspicious circumstance: it renders
it in one sense the typical reality and in another sense perhaps the
sorriest illusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sentience is representable only in fancy</div>

<p>&quot;Reality&quot; is an ambiguous term. If we mean by it the immediate, then
sentience would be a part if not the whole of reality; for what we mean
by sentience or consciousness is the immediate in so far as we contain
it, and whatever self-grounded existence there may be elsewhere can be
conceived by us only mythically and on that analogy, as if it were an
extension or variation of sentience. Psychology would then be knowledge
of reality, for even when consciousness contains elaborate thoughts that
might be full of illusions, psychology takes them only as so much
feeling, and in that capacity they are real enough. At the same time,
while our science terminates upon mere feeling, it can neither discover
nor describe that feeling except in terms of something quite different;
and the only part of psychology that perhaps penetrates to brute
sentience is the part that is not scientific. The knowledge that science
reaches about absolute states of mind is relative knowledge; these
states of mind are approached from without and are defined by their
surrounding conditions and by their ideal objects. They are known by
being enveloped in processes of which they themselves are not aware.
Apart from this setting, the only feeling known is that which is
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162" />endured. After the fact, or before, or from any other point of vantage,
it cannot be directly revealed; at best it may be divined and
re-enacted. Even this possible repetition would not constitute knowledge
unless the imaginative reproduction were identified with or attributed
to some natural fact; so that an adventitious element would always
attach to any recognised feeling, to any feeling reported to another
mind. It could not be known at all unless something were known about it,
so that it might not pass, as otherwise it would, for a mere ingredient
of present sentience.</p>

<p>It is precisely by virtue of this adventitious element that the
re-enacted feeling takes its place in nature and becomes an object of
knowledge. Science furnishes this setting; the jewel&mdash;precious or
false&mdash;must be supplied by imagination. Romance, dramatic myth, is the
only instrument for knowing this sort of &quot;reality.&quot; A flying moment, if
at all <i>understood</i> or underpinned, or if seen in its context, would be
not known absolutely as it had been felt, but would be known
scientifically and as it lay in nature. But dramatic insight, striving
to pierce through the machinery of the world and to attain and repeat
what dreams may be going on at its core, is no science; and the very
notion that the dreams are internal, that they make the interior or
substance of bodies, is a crude materialistic fancy. Body, on the
contrary, is the substance or instrument of mind, and has to be looked
for beneath it. The mind is itself ethereal <a name="Page_163" id="Page_163" />and plays about the body as
music about a violin, or rather as the sense of a page about the print
and paper. To look for it <i>within</i> is not to understand what we are
looking for.</p>

<p>Knowledge of the immediate elsewhere is accordingly visionary in its
method, and furthermore, if, by a fortunate chance, it be true in fact,
it is true only of what in itself is but appearance; for the immediate,
while absolutely real in its stress or presence, is indefinitely
ignorant and false in its deliverance. It knows itself, but in the worst
sense of the word knowledge; for it knows nothing of what is true about
it, nothing of its relations and conditions. To pierce to this blind
&quot;reality&quot; or psychic flux, which is nothing but flying appearance, we
must rely on fortune, or an accidental harmony between imitative fancy
in us now and original sentience elsewhere. It is accordingly at least
misleading to give the name of &quot;reality&quot; to this appearance, which is
entirely lost and inconsequential in its being, without trace of its own
status, and consequently approachable or knowable only by divination, as
a dream might call to another dream.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conditions and objects of sentinence, which are not
sentinence, are also real.</div>

<p>It is preferable to give a more Platonic meaning to the word and to let
&quot;reality&quot; designate not what is merely felt diffusely but what is true
about those feelings. Then dramatic fancy, psychology of the sympathetic
sort, would not be able to reach reality at all. On the <a name="Page_164" id="Page_164" />other hand
scientific psychology, together with all other sciences, would have
reality for its object; for it would disclose what really was true about
sentient moments, without stopping particularly to sink abstractedly
into their inner quality or private semblance. It would approach and
describe the immediate as a sentient factor in a natural situation, and
show us to what extent that situation was represented in that feeling.
This representation, by which the dignity and interest of pure sentience
would be measured, might be either pictorial or virtual; that is, a
conscious moment might represent the environing world either
scientifically, by understanding its structure, or practically, by
instinctive readiness to meet it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mind knowable and important in so far as it represents other
things.</div>

<p>What, for instance, is the reality of Napoleon? Is it what a telepathic
poet, a complete Browning, might reconstruct? Is it Napoleon's life-long
soliloquy? Or to get at the reality should we have to add, as scientific
psychology would, the conditions under which he lived, and their
relation to his casual feelings? Obviously if Napoleon's thoughts had
had no reference to the world we should not be able to recover them; or
if by chance such thoughts fell some day to our share, we should
attribute them to our own mental luxuriance, without suspecting that
they had ever visited another genius. Our knowledge of his life, even
where it is imaginative, depends upon scien<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165" />tific knowledge for its
projection; and his fame and immortality depend on the degree to which
his thoughts, being rooted in the structure of the world and pertinent
to it, can be rationally reproduced in others and attributed to him.
Napoleon's consciousness might perhaps be more justly identified with
the truth or reality of him than could that of most people, because he
seems to have been unusually cognisant of his environment and master of
the forces at work in it and in himself. He understood his causes and
function, and knew that he had <i>arisen</i>, like all the rest of history,
and that he stood for the transmissible force and authority of greater
things. Such a consciousness can be known in proportion as we, too,
possess knowledge, and is worth the pains; something which could not be
said of the absolute sentience of Dick or Harry, which has only material
being, brute existence, without relevance to anything nor understanding
of itself.</p>

<p>The circumstances, open to science, which surround consciousness are
thus real attributes of a man by which he is truly known and
distinguished. Appearances are the qualities of reality, else realities
would be without place, time, character, or interrelation. In knowing
that Napoleon was a Corsican, a short man with a fine countenance, we
know appearances only; but these appearances are true of the reality.
And if the presumable inner appearances, Napoleon's long soliloquy, were
separated from the others, those <a name="Page_166" id="Page_166" />inner appearances would not belong to
Napoleon nor have any home in the knowable world. That which physics,
with its concomitant psychology, might discover in a man is the sum of
what is true about him, seeing that a man is a concretion in existence,
the fragment of a world, and not a definition. Appearances define the
constituent elements of his reality, which could not be better known
than through their means.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>THE NATURE OF INTENT</p>


<div class="sidenote">Dialectic better than physics.</div>

<p>Common knowledge passes from memory to history and from history to
mechanism; and having reached that point it may stop to look back, not
without misgivings, over the course it has traversed, and thus become
psychology. These investigations, taken together, constitute physics, or
the science of existence. But this is only half of science and on the
whole the less interesting and less fundamental half. No existence is of
moment to a man, not even his own, unless it touches his will and
fulfils or thwarts his intent. Unless he is concerned that existences
should be of specific kinds, unless he is interested in form, he can
hardly be interested in being. At the very least in terms of pleasure
versus pain, light versus darkness, comfort versus terror, the flying
moment must be loaded with obloquy or excellence if its passage is not
to remain a dead fact, and to sink from the sphere of actuality
altogether into that droning limbo of potentialities which we call
matter. Being which is indifferent to form is only the material of
being. To exist is nothing if you <a name="Page_168" id="Page_168" />have nothing to do, if there is
nothing to choose or to distinguish, or if those things which belong to
a chosen form are not gathered into it before your eyes, to express what
we call a truth or an excellence.</p>

<p>Existence naturally precedes any idealisation of it which men can
contrive (since they, at least, must exist first), yet in the order of
values knowledge of existence is subsidiary to knowledge of ideals. If
it be true that a good physics is as yet the predominant need in
science, and that man is still most troubled by his ignorance of matters
of fact, this circumstance marks his illiberal condition. Without
knowledge of existence nothing can be done; but nothing is really done
until something else is known also, the use or excellence that existence
may have. It is a great pity that those finer temperaments that are
naturally addressed to the ideal should have turned their energies to
producing bad physics, or to preventing others from establishing natural
truths; for if physics were established on a firm basis the idealists
would for the first time have a free field. They might then recover
their proper function of expressing the mind honestly, and disdain the
sorry attempt to prolong confusion and to fish in troubled waters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Maladjustments to nature render physics conspicuous and
unpleasant.</div>

<p>Perhaps if physical truth had not been so hugely misrepresented in men's
faith and conduct, it would not need to be minutely revealed or
particularly emphasised. When the conditions <a name="Page_169" id="Page_169" />surrounding life are not
rightly faced by instinct they are inevitably forced upon reflection
through painful shocks; and for a long time the new habit thus forced
upon men brings to consciousness not so much the movement of
consciousness itself as the points at which its movement impinges on the
external world and feels checks and frictions. Physics thus becomes
inordinately conspicuous (as when philology submerges the love of
letters) for lack of a good disposition that should allow us to take
physics for granted. Much in nature is delightful to know and to keep in
mind, but much also (the whole infinite remainder) is obscure and
uninteresting; and were we practically well adjusted to its issue we
might gladly absolve ourselves from studying its processes. In a world
that in extent and complexity so far outruns human energies, physical
knowledge ought to be largely virtual; that is, nature ought to be
represented by a suitable attitude toward it, by the attitude which
reason would dictate were knowledge complete, and not by explicit ideas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physics should be largely virtual.</div>

<p>The ancients were happily inspired when they imagined that beyond the
gods and the fixed stars the cosmos came to an end, for the empyrean
beyond was nothing in particular, nothing to trouble one's self about.
Many existences are either out of relation to man altogether or have so
infinitesimal an influence on his experience that they may be
suffi<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170" />ciently represented there by an atom of star-dust; and it is
probable that if, out of pure curiosity, we wished to consider very
remote beings and had the means of doing so, we should find the detail
of existence in them wholly incommensurable with anything we can
conceive. Such beings could be known virtually only, in that we might
speak of them in the right key, representing them in appropriate
symbols, and might move in their company with the right degree of
respectful indifference.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and dialectic explicit.</div>

<p>The present situation of science, however, reverses the ideal one.
Physics, in so far as it exists, is explicit, and at variance with our
acquired attitude toward things; so that we may justly infer, by the
shock our little knowledge gives us, that our presumptions and
assumptions have been so egregious that more knowledge would give us
still greater shocks. Meantime dialectic, or knowledge of ideal things,
remains merely virtual. The ideal usually comes before us only in
revulsions which we cannot help feeling against some scandalous
situation or some intolerable muddle. We have no time or genius left,
after our agitated soundings and balings, to think of navigation as a
fine art, or to consider freely the sea and sky or the land we are
seeking. The proper occupation of the mind is gone, or rather not
initiated.</p>

<p>A further bad consequence of this illiberal state is that, among many
who have, in spite of the times, adoration in their souls, to adore
physics, <a name="Page_171" id="Page_171" />to worship Being, seems a philosophical religion, whereas, of
course, it is the essence of idolatry. The true God is an object of
intent, an ideal of excellence and knowledge, not a term belonging to
sense or to probable hypothesis or to the prudent management of affairs.
After we have squared our accounts with nature and taken sufficient
thought for our bodily necessities, the eyes can be lifted for the first
time to the eternal. The rest was superstition and the quaking use of a
false physics. That appeal to the supernatural which while the danger
threatens is but forlorn medicine, after the blow has fallen may turn to
sublime wisdom. This wisdom has cast out the fear of material evils, and
dreads only that the divine should not come down and be worthily
entertained among us. In art, in politics, in that form of religion
which is superior, and not inferior, to politics and art, we define and
embody intent; and the intent embodied dignifies the work and lends
interest to its conditions. So, in science, it is dialectic that makes
physics speculative and worthy of a free mind. The baser utilities of
material knowledge would leave life itself perfectly vain, if they did
not help it to take on an ideal shape. Ideal life, in so far as it
constitutes science, is dialectical. It consists in seeing how things
hang together perspicuously and how the later phases of any process fill
out&mdash;as in good music&mdash;the tendency and promise of what went before.
This derivation may be mathematical or it may be <a name="Page_172" id="Page_172" />moral; but in either
case the data and problem define the result, dialectic being insight
into their inherent correspondence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intent is vital and indescribable.</div>

<p>Intent is one of many evidences that the intellect's essence is
practical. Intent is action in the sphere of thought; it corresponds to
transition and derivation in the natural world. Analytic psychology is
obliged to ignore intent, for it is obliged to regard it merely as a
feeling; but while the feeling of intent is a fact like any other,
intent itself is an aspiration, a passage, the recognition of an object
which not only is not a part of the feeling given but is often incapable
of being a feeling or a fact at all. What happened to motion under the
Eleatic analysis happens to intent under an anatomising reflection. The
parts do not contain the movement of transition which makes them a
whole. Moral experience is not expressible in physical categories,
because while you may give place and date for every feeling that
something is important or is absurd, you cannot so express what these
feelings have discovered and have wished to confide to you. The
importance and the absurdity have disappeared. Yet it is this
pronouncement concerning what things are absurd or important that makes
the intent of those judgments. To touch it you have to enter the moral
world; that is, you have to bring some sympathetic or hostile judgment
to bear on those you are considering and to meet intent, not by noting
its existence, but by estimating <a name="Page_173" id="Page_173" />its value, by collating it with your
own intent. If some one says two and two are five, you are no
counter-mathematician when you conscientiously put it down that he said
so. Your science is not relevant to his intent until you run some risk
yourself in that arena and say, No: two and two are four.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is analogous to flux in existence</div>

<p>Feelings and ideas, when plucked and separately considered, do not
retain the intent that made them cognitive or living; yet in their
native medium they certainly lived and knew. If this ideality or
transcendence seems a mystery, it is such only in the sense in which
every initial or typical fact is mysterious. Every category would be
unthinkable if it were not actually used. The mystery in this instance
has, however, all that can best serve to make a mystery homely and
amiable. It is supported by a strong analogy to other familiar
mysteries. The fact that intellect has intent, and does not constitute
or contain what it envisages, is like the fact that time flows, that
bodies gravitate, that experience is gathered, or that existence is
suspended between being and not being. Propagation in animals is
mysterious and familiar in the same fashion. Cognition, too, is an
expedient for vanquishing instability. As reproduction circumvents
mortality and preserves a semblance of permanence in the midst of
change, so intent regards what is not yet, or not here, or what exists
no longer. Thus the pulverisation proper to exis<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174" />tence is vanquished by
thought, which in a moment announces or commemorates other moments,
together with the manner of their approach or recession. The mere image
of what is absent constitutes no knowledge of it; a dream is not
knowledge of a world like it existing elsewhere; it is simply another
more fragile world. What renders the image cognitive is the intent that
projects it and deputes it to be representative. It is cognitive only in
use, when it is the vehicle of an assurance which may be right or wrong,
because it takes something ulterior for its standard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It expresses natural life.</div>

<p>We may give intent a somewhat more congenial aspect if we remember that
thought comes to animals in proportion to their docility in the world
and to their practical competence. The more plastic a being is to
experience, so long as he retains vital continuity and a cumulative
structure, the more intelligent he becomes. Intelligence is an
expression of adaptation, of impressionable and prophetic structure.
What wonder, then, that intelligence should speak of the things that
inspire it and that lend it its oracular and practical character,
namely, of things at that moment absent and merely potential, in other
words, of the surrounding world? Mere feeling might suffice to translate
into consciousness each particle of protoplasm in its isolation; but to
translate the relations of that particle to what is not itself and to
express its response to those environing presences, intent and conscious
sig<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175" />nification are required. Intellect transcends the given and means
the absent because life, of which intellect is the fulfilment or
entelechy, is itself absorbed from without and radiated outward. As life
depends on an equilibrium of material processes which reach far beyond
the individual they sustain in being, so intent is a recognition of
outlying existences which sustain in being that very sympathy by which
they are recognised. Intent and life are more than analogous. If we use
the word life in an ideal sense, the two are coincident, for, as
Aristotle says, the act proper to intellect is life.<a name="FNanchor_A_6" id="FNanchor_A_6" /><a href="#Footnote_A_6" class="fnanchor" >[F]</a> The flux is so
pervasive, so subtle in its persistency, that even those miracles which
suspend it must somehow share its destiny. Intent bridges many a chasm,
but only by leaping across. The life that is sustained for years, the
political or moral purpose that may bind whole races together, is
condemned to be partly a memory and partly a plan and wholly an ideal.
Its scope is nothing but the range to which it can continually extend
its sympathies and its power of representation. Its moments have nothing
in common except their loyalties and a conspiring interest in what is
not themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It has a material basis.</div>

<p>This moral energy, so closely analogous to physical interplay, is of
course not without a material basis. Spiritual sublimation does not
consist in not using matter but in using it up, in making it all useful.
When life <a name="Page_176" id="Page_176" />becomes rational it continues to be mechanical and to take up
room and energy in the natural world. That new direction of attention
upon form which finds in facts instances of ideas, does not occur
without a certain heat and labour in the brain. In its most intimate and
supernatural functions intellect has natural conditions. In dreams and
madness intent is confused and wayward, in idiocy it is suspended
altogether; nor has discourse any other pledge that it is addressing
kindred interlocutors except that which it receives from the disposition
and habit of bodies. People who have not yet been born into the world
have not yet begun to think about it.</p>

<p>There is, of course, an inner dialectical relevance among all
propositions that have the same ideal theme, no matter how remote or
unknown to one another those who utter the propositions may be; but the
medium in which this infinite dialectical network is woven is
motionless, and indifferent to the direction in which thought might
traverse it; in other words, it is not discourse or intelligence but
eternal truth. From the point of view of experience this prior
dialectical relation of form to form is merely potential; for the
thoughts between which it would obtain need never exist or be enacted.
There is society only among incarnate ideas; and it is only by
expressing some material situation that an idea is selected out of the
infinity of not impossible ideas and promoted to the temporal dignity of
actual thought.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177" />It is necessarily relevant to earth.</div>

<p>Moreover, even if the faculty of intelligence were disembodied and could
exist in a vacuum, it would still be a vain possession if no data were
given for it to operate upon and if no particular natural structure,
animal, social, or artistic, were at hand for intelligence to ally
itself to and defend. Reason would in that case die of inanition; it
would have no subject-matter and no sanction, as well as no seat.
Intelligence is not a substance; it is a principle of order and of art;
it requires a given situation and some particular natural interest to
bring it into play. In fact, it is nothing but a name for the empire
which conscious, but at bottom irrational, interests attain over the
field in which they operate; it is the fruition of life, the token of
successful operation.</p>

<p>Every theme or motive in the Life of Reason expresses some instinct
rooted in the body and incidental to natural organisation. The intent by
which memory refers to past or absent experience, or the intent by which
perception becomes recognition, is a transcript of relations in which
events actually stand to one another. Such intent represents
modifications of structure and action important to life, modifications
that have responded to forces on which life is dependent. Both desire
and meaning translate into cognitive or ideal energy, into intent,
mechanical relations subsisting in nature. These mechanical relations
give practical force to the thought that expresses them, <a name="Page_178" id="Page_178" />and the
thought in turn gives significance and value to the forces that subserve
it. Fulfilment is mutual, in one direction bringing material
potentialities to the light and making them actual and conscious, and in
the other direction embodying intent in the actual forms of things and
manifesting reason. Nothing could be more ill-considered than the desire
to disembody reason. Reason cries aloud for reunion with the material
world which she needs not only for a basis but, what concerns her even
more, for a theme.</p>

<p>In private and silent discourse, when words and grammar are swathed in
reverie, the material basis and reference of thought may be forgotten.
Desire and intent may then seem to disport themselves in a purely ideal
realm; moral or logical tensions alone may seem to determine the whole
process. Meditative persons are even inclined to regard the disembodied
life which they think they enjoy at such times as the true and native
form of experience; all organs, applications, and expressions of thought
they deprecate and call accidental. As some pious souls reject dogma to
reach pure faith and suspend prayer to enjoy union, so some mystical
logicians drop the world in order to grasp reality. It is an exquisite
suicide; but the energy and ideal that sustain such a flight are
annihilated by its issue, and the soul drops like a paper balloon
consumed by the very flame that wafted it. No thought is found without
an organ; none is conceivable without an ex<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179" />pression which is that
organ's visible emanation; and none would be significant without a
subject-matter lying in the world of which that organ is a part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The basis of intent becomes appreciable in language.</div>

<p>The natural structure underlying intent is latent in silent thought, and
its existence might be denied by a sceptical thinker over whose mind the
analogies and spirit of physics exercised little influence. This
hypothetical structure is not, however, without obvious extensions which
imply its existence even where we do not perceive it directly. A smile
or a blush makes visible to the observer movements which must have been
at work in the body while thought occupied the mind&mdash;even if, as more
often happens, the blush or smile did not precede and introduce the
feeling they suggest, the feeling which in our verbal mythology is said
to cause them. No one would be so simple as to suppose that such
involuntary signs of feeling spring directly and by miracle out of
feeling. They surely continue some previous bodily commotion which
determines their material character, so that laughter, for instance,
becomes a sign of amusement rather than of rage, which it might just as
well have represented, so far as the abstract feeling itself is
concerned.</p>

<p>In the same way a sigh, a breath, a word are but the last stage and
superficial explosion of nervous tensions, tensions which from the point
of view of their other eventual expressions we might call <a name="Page_180" id="Page_180" />interplaying
impulses or potential memories. As these material seethings underlay the
budding thought, so the uttered word, when it comes, underlies the
perfect conception. The word, in so far as it is material, undeniably
continues an internal material process, for aphasia and garrulity have
known physical causes. In the vibrations which we call words the hidden
complexities of cerebral action fly out, so to speak, into the air; they
become recognisable sounds emitted by lips and tongue and received by
the ear. The uttered word produces an obvious commotion in nature;
through it thought, being expressed in that its material basis is
extended outward, becomes at the same moment rational and practical; for
its expression enters into the chain of its future conditions and
becomes an omen of that thought's continuance, repetition, and
improvement. Thought's rational function consists, as we then perceive,
in expressing a natural situation and improving that situation by
expressing it, until such expression becomes a perfect and adequate
state of knowledge, which justifies both itself and its conditions.
Expression makes thought a power in the very world from which thought
drew its being, and renders it in some measure self-sustaining and
self-assured.</p>

<p>A thirsty man, let us say, begs for drink. Had his petition been a
wordless desire it might have been supposed, though falsely, to be a
disembodied and quite immaterial event, a transcendental atti<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181" />tude of
will, without conditions or consequences, but somehow with an absolute
moral dignity. But when the petition became articulate and audible to a
fellow-mortal, who thereupon proceeded to fetch a cup of water, the
desire, through the cry that expressed it, obviously asserted itself in
the mechanical world, to which it already secretly belonged by virtue of
its cause, a parched body. This material background for moral energy,
which even an inarticulate yearning would not have lacked, becomes in
language an overt phenomenon, linked observably with all other objects
and processes.</p>

<p>Language is accordingly an overflow of the physical basis of thought. It
is an audible gesture, more refined than the visible, but in the same
sense an automatic extension of nervous and muscular processes. Words
underlie the thought they are said to express&mdash;in truth it is the
thought that is the flower and expression of the language&mdash;much as the
body underlies the mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intent starts from a datum.</div>

<p>Language contains, side by side two distinct elements. One is the
meaning or sense of the words&mdash;a logical projection given to sensuous
terms. The other is the sensuous vehicle of that meaning&mdash;the sound,
sign, or gesture. This sensuous term is a fulcrum for the lever of
signification, a <i>point d'appui</i> which may be indefinitely attenuated in
rapid discourse, but not altogether discarded. Intent though it vaults
high must have something to <a name="Page_182" id="Page_182" />spring from, or it would lend meaning to
nothing. The minimal sensuous term that subsists serves as a clue to a
whole system of possible assertions radiating from it. It becomes the
sign for an essence or idea, a logical hypostasis corresponding in
discourse to that material hypostasis of perceptions which is called an
external thing.</p>

<p>The hypostasised total of rational and just discourse is the truth. Like
the physical world, the truth is external and in the main potential. Its
ideal consistency and permanence serve to make it a standard and
background for fleeting assertions, just as the material hypostasis
called nature is the standard and background for all momentary
perceptions. What exists of truth in direct experience is at any moment
infinitesimal, as what exists of nature is, but all that either contains
might be represented in experience at one time or another.<a name="FNanchor_A_7" id="FNanchor_A_7" /><a href="#Footnote_A_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183" />and is carried by a feeling.</div>

<p>The tensions and relations of words which make grammar or make poetry
are immediate in essence, the force of language being just as empirical
as the reality of things. To ask a thinker what he means by meaning is
as futile as to ask a carpenter what he means by wood; to discover it
you must emulate them and repeat their experience&mdash;which indeed you will
hardly be able to do if some sophist has so entangled your reason that
you can neither understand what you see nor assert what you mean. But as
the carpenter's acquaintance with wood might be considerably refined if
he became a naturalist or liberalised if he became a carver, so a casual
speaker's sense of what he means might be better focussed by dialectic
and more delicately shaded by literary training. Meantime the vital act
called intent, by which consciousness becomes cognitive and practical,
would remain at heart an indescribable experience, a sense of spiritual
life as radical and specific as the sense of heat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It demands conventional expression.</div>

<p>Significant language forms a great system of ideal tensions, contained
in the mutual relations of parts of speech, and of clauses in
propositions. Of these tensions the intent in a man's mind at any moment
is a living specimen. Experience at that moment may have a significance,
a transitive force, that asks to be enshrined in some perma<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184" />nent
expression; the more acute and irrevocable the crisis is, the more
urgent the need of transmitting to other moments some cognisance of what
was once so great. But were this experience to exhale its spirit in a
vacuum, using no conventional and transmissible medium of expression, it
would be foiled in its intent. It would leave no monument and achieve no
immortality in the world of representation; for the experience and its
expression would remain identical and perish together, just as a
perception and its object would remain identical and perish together if
there were no intelligence to discover the material world, to which the
perplexing shifts of sensation may be habitually referred. Spontaneous
expression, if it is to be recognisable and therefore in effect
expressive, labours under the necessity of subordinating itself to an
ideal system of expressions, a permanent language in which its
spontaneous utterances may be embedded. By virtue of such adoption into
a common medium expression becomes interpretable; a later moment may
then reconstruct the past out of its surviving memorial.</p>

<p>Intent, beside the form it has in language, where it makes the soul of
grammar, has many other modes of expression, in mathematical and logical
reasoning, in action, and in those contemplated and suspended acts which
we call estimation, policy, or morals. Moral philosophy, the wisdom of
Socrates, is merely a consideration of <a name="Page_185" id="Page_185" />intent. In intent we pass over
from existence to ideality, the nexus lying in the propulsive nature of
life which could not have been capped by any form of knowledge which was
not itself in some way transitive and ambitious. Intent, though it looks
away from existence and the actual, is the most natural and pervasive of
things. Physics and dialectic meet in this: that the second brings to
fruition what the first describes, namely, existence, and that both have
their transcendental root in the flux of being. Matter cannot exist
without some form, much as by shedding every form in succession it may
proclaim its aversion to fixity and its radical formlessness or
infinitude. Nor can form, without the treacherous aid of matter, pass
from its ideal potentiality into selected and instant being.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A fable about matter and form.</div>

<p>In order to live&mdash;if such a myth may be allowed&mdash;the Titan Matter was
eager to disguise his incorrigible vagueness and pretend to be
something. He accordingly addressed himself to the beautiful company of
Forms, sisters whom he thought all equally beautiful, though their
number was endless, and equally fit to satisfy his heart. He wooed them
hypocritically, with no intention of wedding them; yet he uttered their
names in such seductive accents (called by mortals intelligence and
toil) that the virgin goddesses offered no resistance&mdash;at least such of
them as happened to be near or of a facile disposition. They were
pres<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186" />ently deserted by their unworthy lover; yet they, too, in that
moment's union, had tasted the sweetness of life. The heaven to which
they returned was no longer an infinite mathematical paradise. It was
crossed by memories of earth, and a warmer breath lingered in some of
its lanes and grottoes. Henceforth its nymphs could not forget that they
had awakened a passion, and that, unmoved themselves, they had moved a
strange indomitable giant to art and love.</p>

indistinguishable from an absolute motionless intellect, which should no

indistinguishable from an absolute motionless experience, which should
no longer be a foreshortening or representation of anything. This
existence would be motionless in the sense that it would &quot;mark time,&quot;
for of course every fact in it might be a fact of transition. The whole
system, however, would have a static ideal constitution, since the fact
that things change in a certain way or stand in a certain order is as
much a fact as any other; and it is not a logical necessity, either, but
a brute matter of fact that might well have been otherwise.</p></div>

<p style='text-align: center;'>DIALECTIC</p>


<div class="sidenote">Dialectic elaborates given forms.</div>

<p>The advantage which the mechanical sciences have over history is drawn
from their mathematical form. Mathematics has somewhat the same place in
physics that conscience has in action; it seems to be a directive
principle in natural operations where it is only a formal harmony. The
formalistic school, which treats grammar in all departments as if it
were the ground of import rather than a means of expressing it, takes
mathematics also for an oracular deliverance, springing full-armed out
of the brain, and setting up a canon which all concrete things must
conform to. Thus mathematical science has become a mystery which a myth
must be constructed to solve. For how can it happen, people ask, that
pure intuition, retreating into its cell, can evolve there a prodigious
system of relations which it carries like a measuring-rod into the world
and lo! everything in experience submits to be measured by it? What
pre-established harmony is this between the spinning cerebral silkworm
and nature's satins and brocades?</p>

<p><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188" />If we but knew, so the myth runs, that experience can show no patterns
but those which the prolific Mind has woven, we should not wonder at
this necessary correspondence. The Mind having decreed of its own
motion, while it sat alone before the creation of the world, that it
would take to dreaming mathematically, it evoked out of nothing all
formal necessities; and later, when it felt some solicitation to play
with things, it imposed those forms upon all its toys, admitting none of
any other sort into the nursery. In other words, perception perfected
its grammar before perceiving any of its objects, and having imputed
that grammar to the materials of sense, it was able to perceive objects
for the first time and to legislate further about their relations.</p>

<p>The most obvious artifices of language are often the most deceptive and
bring on epidemic prejudices. What is this Mind, this machine existing
prior to existence? The mind that exists is only a particular department
or focus of existence; its principles cannot be its own source, much
less the source of anything in other beings. Mathematical principles in
particular are not imposed on existence or on nature <i>ab extra</i>, but are
found in and abstracted from the subject-matter and march of experience.
To exist things have to wear some form, and the form they happen to wear
is largely mathematical. This being the case, the mind in shaping its
barbarous prosody somewhat more closely to the nature of things, <a name="Page_189" id="Page_189" />learns
to note and to abstract the form that so strikingly defines them. Once
abstracted and focussed in the mind, these forms, like all forms, reveal
their dialectic; but that things conform to that dialectic (when they
do) is not wonderful, seeing that it is the obvious form of things that
the mind has singled out, not without practical shrewdness, for more
intensive study.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forms are abstracted from existence by intent.</div>

<p>The difference between ideal and material knowledge does not lie in the
ungenerated oracular character of one of them in opposition to the
other; in both the data are inexplicable and irrational, and in both
investigation is tentative, observant, and subject to control by the
subject-matter. The difference lies, rather, in the direction of
speculation. In physics, which is at bottom historical, we study what
happens; we make inventories and records of events, of phenomena, of
juxtapositions. In dialectic, which is wholly intensive, we study what
is; we strive to clarify and develop the essence of what we find,
bringing into focus the inner harmonies and implications of forms&mdash;forms
which our attention or purpose has defined initially. The intuitions
from which mathematical deduction starts are highly generic notions
drawn from observation. The lines and angles of geometers are ideals,
and their ideal context is entirely independent of what may be their
context in the world; but they are found in the world, and their ideals
are suggested by very <a name="Page_190" id="Page_190" />common sensations. Had they been invented, by
some inexplicable parthenogenesis in thought, it would indeed have been
a marvel had they found application. Philosophy has enough notions of
this inapplicable sort&mdash;usually, however, not very recondite in their
origin&mdash;to show that dialectic, when it seems to control existence, must
have taken more than one hint from the subject world, and that in the
realm of logic, too, nothing submits to be governed without
representation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confusion comes of imperfect abstraction, or ambiguous
intent.</div>

<p>When dialectic is employed, as in ethics and metaphysics, upon highly
complex ideas&mdash;concretions in discourse which cover large blocks of
existence&mdash;the dialectician in defining and in deducing often reaches
notions which cease to apply in some important respect to the object
originally intended. Thus Socrates, taking &quot;courage&quot; for his theme,
treats it dialectically and expresses the intent of the word by saying
that courage must be good, and then develops the meaning of good,
showing that it means the choice 01 the greater benefit; and finally
turns about and ends by saying that courage is consequently the choice
of the greater benefit and identical with wisdom. Here we have a process
of thought ending in a paradox which, frankly, misrepresents the
original meaning. For &quot;courage&quot; meant not merely something desirable but
something having a certain animal and psychological aspect. The emotion
and gesture of it had not been excluded from the <a name="Page_191" id="Page_191" />idea. So that while
the argument proves to perfection that unwise courage is a bad thing, it
does not end with an affirmation really true of the original concept.
The instinct which we call courage, with an eye to its psychic and
bodily quality, is not always virtuous or wise. Dialectic, when it
starts with confused and deep-dyed feelings, like those which ethical
and metaphysical terms generally stand for, is thus in great danger of
proving unsatisfactory and being or seeming sophistical.</p>

<p>The mathematical dialectician has no such serious dangers to face. When,
having observed the sun and sundry other objects, he frames the idea of
a circle and tracing out its intent shows that the circle meant cannot
be squared, there is no difficulty in reverting to nature and saying
that the sun's circle cannot be squared. For there is no difference in
intent between the circularity noted in the sun and that which is the
subject of the demonstration. The geometer has made in his first
reflection so clear and violent an abstraction from the sun's actual
bulk and qualities that he will never imagine himself to be speaking of
anything but a concretion in discourse. The concretion in nature is
never legislated about nor so much as thought of except possibly when,
under warrant of sense, it is chosen to illustrate the concept
investigated dialectically. It does not even occur to a man to ask if
the sun's circle can be squared, for every one understands that the sun
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192" />is circular only in so far as it conforms to the circle's ideal nature;
which is as if Socrates and his interlocutors had clearly understood
that the <i>virtue</i> of courage in an intemperate villain meant only
whatever in his mood or action was rational and truly desirable, and had
then said that courage, so understood, was identical with wisdom or with
the truly rational and desirable rule of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fact that mathematics applies to existence is empirical.</div>

<p>The applicability of mathematics is not vouched for by mathematics but
by sense, and its application in some distant part of nature is not
vouched for by mathematics but by inductive arguments about nature's
uniformity, or by the character which the notion, &quot;a distant part of
nature,&quot; already possesses. Inapplicable mathematics, we are told, is
perfectly thinkable, and systematic deductions, in themselves valid, may
be made from concepts which contravene the facts of perception. We may
suspect, perhaps, that even these concepts are framed by analogy out of
suggestions found in sense, so that some symbolic relevance or
proportion is kept, even in these dislocated speculations, to the matter
of experience. It is like a new mythology; the purely fictitious idea
has a certain parallelism and affinity to nature and moves in a human
and familiar way. Both data and method are drawn from applicable
science, elements of which even myth, whether poetic or mathematical,
may illustrate by a sort of variant or fantastic reduplication.</p>

<p><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193" />The great glory of mathematics, like that of virtue, is to be useful
while remaining free. Number and measure furnish an inexhaustible
subject-matter which the mind can dominate and develop dialectically as
it is the mind's inherent office to develop ideas. At the same time
number and measure are the grammar of sense; and the more this inner
logic is cultivated and refined the greater subtlety and sweep can be
given to human perception. Astronomy on the one hand and mechanical arts
on the other are fruits of mathematics by which its worth is made known
even to the layman, although the born mathematician would not need the
sanction of such an extraneous utility to attach him to a subject that
has an inherent cogency and charm. Ideas, like other things, have
pleasure in propagation, and even when allowance is made for birth-pangs
and an occasional miscarriage, their native fertility will always
continue to assert itself. The more ideal and frictionless the movement
of thought is, the more perfect must be the physiological engine that
sustains it. The momentum of that silent and secluded growth carries the
mind, with a sense of pure disembodied vision, through the logical
labyrinth; but the momentum is vital, for the truth itself does not
move.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its moral value is therefore contingent.</div>

<p>Whether the airy phantoms thus brought into being are valued and
preserved by the world is an ulterior point of policy which the pregnant
mathematician does not need to consider in bring<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194" />ing to light the
legitimate burden of his thoughts. But were mathematics incapable of
application, did nature and experience, for instance, illustrate nothing
but Parmenides' Being or Hegel's Logic, the dialectical cogency which
mathematics would of course retain would not give this science a very
high place in the Life of Reason. Mathematics would be an amusement, and
though apparently innocent, like a game of patience, it might even turn
out to be a wasteful and foolish exercise for the mind; because to
deepen habits and cultivate pleasures irrelevant to other interests is a
way of alienating ourselves from our general happiness. Distinction and
a curious charm there may well be in such a pursuit, but this quality is
perhaps traceable to affinities and associations with other more
substantial interests, or is due to the ingenious temper it denotes,
which touches that of the wit or magician. Mathematics, if it were
nothing more than a pleasure, might conceivably become a vice. Those
addicted to it might be indulging an atavistic taste at the expense of
their humanity. It would then be in the position now occupied by
mythology and mysticism. Even as it is, mathematicians share with
musicians a certain partiality in their characters and mental
development. Masters in one abstract subject, they may remain children
in the world; exquisite manipulators of the ideal, they may be erratic
and clumsy in their earthly ways. Immense as are the uses and wide <a name="Page_195" id="Page_195" />the
applications of mathematics, its texture is too thin and inhuman to
employ the whole mind or render it harmonious. It is a science which
Socrates rejected for its supposed want of utility; but perhaps he had
another ground in reserve to justify his humorous prejudice. He may have
felt that such a science, if admitted, would endanger his thesis about
the identity of virtue and knowledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quantity submits easily to dialectical treatment.</div>

<p>Mathematical method has been the envy of philosophers, perplexed and
encumbered as they are with the whole mystery of existence, and they
have attempted at times to emulate mathematical cogency. Now the
lucidity and certainty found in mathematics are not inherent in its
specific character as the science of number or dimension; they belong to
dialectic as a whole which is essentially elucidation. The effort to
explain meanings is in most cases abortive because these meanings melt
in our hands&mdash;a defeat which Hegel would fain have consecrated, together
with all other evils, into necessity and law. But the merit of
mathematics is that it is so much less Hegelian than life; that it holds
its own while it advances, and never allows itself to misrepresent its
original intent. In all it finds to say about the triangle it never
comes to maintain that the triangle is really a square. The privilege of
mathematics is simply to have offered the mind, for dialectical
treatment, a material to which dia<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196" />lectical treatment could be honestly
applied. This material consists in certain general aspects of
sensation&mdash;its extensity, its pulsation, its distribution into related
parts. The wakefulness that originally makes these abstractions is able
to keep them clear, and to elaborate them infinitely without
contradicting their essence.</p>

<p>For this reason it is always a false step in mathematical science, a
step over its brink into the abyss beyond, when we try to reduce its
elements to anything not essentially sensible. Intuition must continue
to furnish the subject of discourse, the axioms, and the ultimate
criteria and sanctions. Calculation and transmutation can never make
their own counters or the medium in which they move. So that space,
number, continuity, and every other elementary intuition remains at
bottom opaque&mdash;opaque, that is, to mathematical science; for it is no
paradox, but an obvious necessity, that the data of a logical operation
should not be producible by its workings. Reason would have nothing to
do if it had no irrational materials. Saint Augustine's rhetoric
accordingly covered&mdash;as so often with him&mdash;a profound truth when he said
of time that he knew what it was when no one asked him, but if any one
asked him he did not know; which may be restated by saying that time is
an intuition, an aspect of crude experience, which science may work with
but which it can never arrive at.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constancy and progress in intent.</div>

<p>When a concretion is formed in discourse and <a name="Page_197" id="Page_197" />an intent is attained in
consciousness, predicates accrue to the subject in a way which is
perfectly empirical. Dialectic is not retrospective; it does not consist
in recovering ground previously surveyed. The accretion of new
predicates comes in answer to chance questions, questions raised, to be
sure, about a given theme. The subject is fixed by the mind's intent and
it suffices to compare any tentative assertion made about it with that
intent itself to see whether the expression suggested for it is truly
dialectical and thoroughly honest. Dialectic verifies by
reconsideration, by equation of tentative results with fixed intentions.
It does not verify, like the sciences of existence, by comparing a
hypothesis with a new perception. In dialectic no new <i>perception</i> is
wanted; the goal is to understand the old fact, to give it an aureole
and not a progeny. It is a transubstantiation of matter, a passage from
existence to eternity. In this sense dialectic is &quot;synthetic <i>a
priori</i>&quot;; it analyses an intent which demanded further elucidation and
had fixed the direction and principle of its expansion. If this intent
is abandoned and a new subject is introduced surreptitiously, a fallacy
is committed; yet the correct elucidation of ideas is a true progress,
nor could there be any progress unless the original idea were better
expressed and elicited as we proceeded; so that constancy in intent and
advance in explication are the two requisites of a cogent deduction.</p>

<p><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198" />The question in dialectic is always what is true, what can be said,
about <i>this</i>; and the demonstrative pronoun, indicating an act of
selective attention, raises the object it selects to a concretion in
discourse, the relations of which in the universe of discourse it then
proceeds to formulate. At the same time this dialectical investigation
may be full of surprises. Knowledge may be so truly enriched by it that
<i>knowledge</i>, in an ideal sense, only begins when dialectic has given
some articulation to being. Without dialectic an animal might follow
instinct, he might have vivid emotions, expectations, and dreams, but he
could hardly be said to know anything or to guide his life with
conscious intent. The accretions that might come empirically into any
field of vision would not be new predicates to be added to a known
thing, unless the logical and functional mantle of that thing fell upon
them and covered them. While the right of particulars to existence is
their own, granted them by the free grace of heaven, their ability to
enlarge our knowledge on any particular subject&mdash;their relevance or
incidence in discourse&mdash;hangs on their fulfilling the requirements which
that subject's dialectical nature imposes on all its expressions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intent determines the functional essence of objects.</div>

<p>It is on this ground, for instance, that the image of a loaf of bread is
so far from being the loaf of bread itself. External resemblance is
nothing; even psychological derivation or superposi<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199" />tion is nothing; the
intent, rather, which picks out what that object's function and meaning
shall be, alone defines its idea; and this function involves a locus and
a status which the image does not possess. Such admirable iridescence as
the image might occasionally put on&mdash;in the fine arts, for
instance&mdash;would not constitute any iridescence or transformation in the
thing; nor would identity of aspect preserve the thing if its soul, if
its utility, had disappeared. Herein lies the ground for the essential
or functional distinction between primary and secondary qualities in
things, a distinction which a psychological scepticism has so hastily
declared to be untenable. If it was discovered, said these logicians,
that space was perceived through reading muscular sensations, space, and
the muscles too, were thereby proved to be unreal. This remarkable
sophism passed muster in the philosophical world for want of attention
to dialectic, which might so easily have shown that what a thing <i>means</i>
is spatial distinction and mechanical efficacy, and that the origin of
our perceptions, which are all equally bodily and dependent on material
stimulation, has nothing to do with their respective claims to
hypostasis. It is intent that makes objects objects; and the same
intent, defining the function of things, defines the scope of those
qualities which are essential to them. In the flux substances and
shadows drift down together; it is reason that discerns the difference.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200" />Also the scope of ideals.</div>

<p>Purposes need dialectical articulation as much as essences do, and
without an articulate and fixed purpose, without an ideal, action would
collapse into mere motion or conscious change. It is notably in this
region that elucidation constitutes progress; for to understand the
properties of number may be less important than empirically to count;
but to see and feel the values of things in all their distinction and
fulness is the ultimate fruit of efficiency; it is mastery in that art
of life for which all the rest is apprenticeship. Dialectic of this sort
is practised intuitively by spiritual minds; and even when it has to be
carried on argumentatively it may prove very enlightening. That the
excellence of courage is identical with that of wisdom still needs to be
driven home; and that the excellence of poetry is identical with that of
all other things probably sounds like a blind paradox. Yet did not all
excellences conspire to one end and meet in one Life of Reason, how
could their relative value be estimated, or any reflective sanction be
found for them at all? The miscellaneous, captious fancies of the will,
the menagerie of moral prejudices, still call for many a Socrates to
tame them. So long as courage means a grimace of mind or body, the love
of it is another grimace. But if it meant the value, recognisable by
reason and diffused through all life, which that casual attitude or
feeling might have, then we should be launched upon the quest for
wisdom.</p>

<p><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201" />The want of integration in moral views is like what want of integration
would be in arithmetic if we declared that it was the part of a man and
a Christian to maintain that <i>my</i> two equals four or that a <i>green</i>
fifteen is a hundred. These propositions might have incidental lights
and shades in people's lives to make them plausible and precious; but
they could not be maintained by one who had clarified his intent in
naming and adding. For then the arithmetical relations would be
abstracted, and their incidental associates would drop out of the
account. So a man who is in pursuit of things for the good that is in
them must recognise and (if reason avails) must pursue what is good in
them all. Strange customs and unheard-of thoughts may then find their
appropriate warrant; just as in higher mathematical calculations very
wonderful and unforeseen results may be arrived at, which a man will not
accept without careful reconsideration of the terms and problem before
him; but if he finds the unexpected conclusion flowing from those
premises, he will have enlarged his knowledge of his art and discovered
a congenial good. He will have made progress in the Socratic science of
knowing his own intent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Double status of mathematics.</div>

<p>Mathematics, for all its applications in nature, is a part of ideal
philosophy. It is logic applied to certain simple intuitions. These
intuitions and many of their developments happen to appear in that
effi<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202" />cacious and self-sustaining moiety of being which we call material;
so that mathematics is <i>per accidens</i> the dialectical study of nature's
efficacious form. Its use and application in the world rather hide its
dialectical principle. Mathematics owes its public success to the happy
choice of a simple and widely diffused subject-matter; it owes its inner
cogency, however, to its ideality and the merely adventitious
application it has to existence. Mathematics has come to seem the type
of good logic because it is an illustration of logic in a sphere so
highly abstract in idea and so pervasive in sense as to be at once
manageable and useful.</p>

<p>The delights and triumphs of mathematics ought, therefore, to be a great
encouragement to ideal philosophy. If in a comparatively uninteresting
field attention can find so many treasures of harmony and order, what
beauties might it not discover in interpreting faithfully ideas nobler
than extension and number, concretions closer to man's spiritual life?
But unfortunately the logic of values is subject to voluntary and
involuntary confusions of so discouraging a nature that the flight of
dialectic in that direction has never been long and, even when short,
often disastrous. What is needed, as the example of mathematics shows,
is a steadfast intent and an adventurous inquiry. It would not occur to
a geometer to ask with trepidation what difference it would make to the
Pythagorean proposition if the hypothenuse were said to be wise and
good. Yet metaphysi<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203" />cians, confounding dialectic with physics and
thereby corrupting both, will discuss for ever the difference it makes
to substance whether you call it matter or God. Nevertheless, no
decorative epithets can give substance any other attributes than those
which it has; that is, other than the actual appearances that substance
is needed to support. Similarly, neither mathematicians nor astronomers
are exercised by the question whether [Greek: pi] created the ring of
Saturn; yet naturalists and logicians have not rejected the analogous
problem whether the good did or did not create the animals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Practical r&ocirc;le of dialectic.</div>

<p>So long as in using terms there is no fixed intent, no concretion in
discourse with discernible predicates, controversy will rage as
conceptions waver and will reach no valid result. But when the force of
intellect, once having arrested an idea amid the flux of perceptions,
avails to hold and examine that idea with perseverance, not only does a
flash of light immediately cross the mind, but deeper and deeper vistas
are opened there into ideal truth. The principle of dialectic is
intelligence itself; and as no part of man's economy is more vital than
intelligence (since intelligence is what makes life aware of its
destiny), so no part has a more delightful or exhilarating movement. To
understand is pre-eminently to live, moving not by stimulation and
external compulsion, but by inner direction and control. Dialectic is
related to observation as art is to industry; it uses what the <a name="Page_204" id="Page_204" />other
furnishes; it is the fruition of experience. It is not an alternative to
empirical pursuits but their perfection; for dialectic, like art, has no
special or private subject-matter, nor any obligation to be useless. Its
subject-matter is all things, and its function is to compare them in
form and worth, giving the mind speculative dominion over them. It
profits by the flux to fix its signification. This is precisely what
mathematics does for the abstract form and multitude of sensible things;
it is what dialectic might do everywhere, with the same incidental
utility, if it could settle its own attitude and learn to make the
passions steadfast and calm in the consciousness of their ultimate
objects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hegel's satire on dialectic.</div>

<p>The nature of dialectic might be curiously illustrated by reference to
Hegel's Logic; and though to approach the subject from Hegel's satirical
angle is not, perhaps, quite honest or fair, the method has a certain
spice. Hegel, who despised mathematics, saw that in other departments
the instability of men's meanings defeated their desire to understand
themselves. This insecurity in intent he found to be closely connected
with change of situation, with the natural mutability of events and
opinions in the world. Instead of showing, however, what inroads
passion, oblivion, sophistry, and frivolity may make into dialectic, he
bethought himself to represent all these incoherences, which are indeed
significant of natural changes, as the march of <a name="Page_205" id="Page_205" />dialectic itself, thus
identified with the process of evolution and with natural law. The
romance of an unstable and groping theology, full of warm intentions and
impossible ideas, he took to be typical of all experience and of all
science.</p>

<p>In that impressionable age any effect of <i>chiaro-oscuro</i> caught in the
moonlight of history could find a philosopher to exalt it into the
darkly luminous secret of the world. Hegel accordingly decreed that
men's habit of self-contradiction constituted their providential
function, both in thought and in morals; and he devoted his Logic to
showing how every idea they embraced (for he never treated an idea
otherwise than as a creed), when pressed a little, turned into its
opposite. This opposite after a while would fall back into something
like the original illusion; whereupon a new change of insight would
occur and a new thought would be accepted until, the landscape changing,
attention would be attracted to a fresh aspect of the matter and
conviction would wander into a new labyrinth of false steps and
half-meanings. The sum total of these wanderings, when viewed from
above, formed an interesting picture. A half-mystical, half-cynical
reflection might take a certain pleasure in contemplating it; especially
if, in memory of Calvin and the Stoics, this situation were called the
expression of Absolute Reason and Divine Will.</p>

<p>We may think for a moment that we have grasped the elusive secret of
this philosophy and <a name="Page_206" id="Page_206" />that it is simply a Calvinism without Christianity,
in which God's glory consists in the damnation of quite all his
creatures. Presently, however, the scene changes again, and we recognise
that Creator and creation, ideal and process, are identical, so that the
glory belongs to the very multitude that suffers. But finally, as we rub
our eyes, the whole revelation collapses into a platitude, and we
discover that this glory and this damnation were nothing but unctuous
phrases for the vulgar flux of existence.</p>

<p>That nothing is what we mean by it is perfectly true when we in no case
know what we mean. Thus a man who is a mystic by nature may very well
become one by reflection also. Not knowing what he wants nor what he is,
he may believe that every shift carries him nearer to perfection. A
temperamental and quasi-religious thirst for inconclusiveness and room
to move on lent a certain triumphant note to Hegel's satire; he was sure
it all culminated in something, and was not sure it did not culminate in
himself. The system, however, as it might strike a less egotistical
reader, is a long demonstration of man's ineptitude and of nature's
contemptuous march over a path paved with good intentions. It is an
idealism without respect for ideals; a system of dialectic in which a
psychological flux (not, of course, psychological science, which would
involve terms dialectically fixed and determinate) is made
systematically to obliterate intended meanings.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207" />Dialectic expresses a given intent.</div>

<p>This spirited travesty of logic has enough historical truth in it to
show that dialectic must always stand, so to speak, on its apex; for
life is changeful, and the vision and interest of one moment are not
understood in the next. Theological dialectic rings hollow when once
faith is dead; grammar looks artificial when a language is foreign;
mathematics itself seems shallow when, like Hegel, we have no love for
nature's intelligible mechanism nor for the clear structure and
constancy of eternal things. Ideal philosophy is a flower of the spirit
and varies with the soil. If mathematics suffers so little
contradiction, it is only because the primary aspects of sensation which
it elaborates could not lapse from the world without an utter break in
its continuity. Otherwise though mathematics might not be refuted it
might well be despised, like an obsolete ontology. Its boasted necessity
and universality would not help it at all if experience should change so
much as to present no further mathematical aspect. Those who expect to
pass at death into a non-spatial and super-temporal world, where there
will be no detestable extended and unthinking substances, and nothing
that need be counted, will find their hard-learned mathematics sadly
superfluous there. The memory of earthly geometry and arithmetic will
grow pale amid that floating incense and music, where dialectic, if it
survives at all, will have to busy itself on new intuitions.</p>

<p><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208" />So, too, when the landscape changes in the moral world, when new
passions or arts make their appearance, moral philosophy must start
afresh on a new foundation and try to express the ideals involved in the
new pursuits. To this extent experience lends colour to Hegel's
dialectical physics; but he betrayed, like the sincere pantheist he was,
the finite interests that give actual values to the world, and he wished
to bestow instead a groundless adoration on the law that connected and
defeated every ideal. Such a genius, in spite of incisive wit and a
certain histrionic sympathy with all experience, could not be truly
free; it could not throw off its professional priestcraft, its habit of
ceremonious fraud on the surface, nor, at heart, its inhuman religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its empire is ideal and autonomous.</div>

<p>The sincere dialectician, the genuine moralist, must stand upon human,
Socratic ground. Though art be long, it must take a short life for its
basis and an actual interest for its guide. The liberal dialectician has
the gift of conversation; he does not pretend to legislate from the
throne of Jehovah about the course of affairs, but asks the ingenuous
heart to speak for itself, guiding and checking it only in its own
interest. The result is to express a given nature and to cultivate it;
so that whenever any one possessing such a nature is born into the world
he may use this calculation, and more easily understand and justify his
mind. Of course, if experience were no longer the same, and faculties
had <a name="Page_209" id="Page_209" />entirely varied, the former interpretation could no longer serve.
Where nature shows a new principle of growth the mind must find a new
method of expression, and move toward other goals. Ideals are not forces
stealthily undermining the will; they are possible forms of being that
would frankly express it. These forms are invulnerable, eternal, and
free; and he who finds them divine and congenial and is able to embody
them at least in part and for a season, has to that extent transfigured
life, turning it from a fatal process into a liberal art.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>PRERATIONAL MORALITY</p>


<div class="sidenote">Empirical alloy in dialectic.</div>

<p>When a polyglot person is speaking, foreign words sometimes occur to
him, which he at once translates into the language he happens to be
using. Somewhat in the same way, when dialectic develops an idea,
suggestions for this development may come from the empirical field; yet
these suggestions soon shed their externality and their place is taken
by some genuine development of the original notion. In constructing, for
instance, the essence of a circle, I may have started from a hoop. I may
have observed that as the hoop meanders down the path the roundness of
it disappears to the eye, being gradually flattened into a straight
line, such as the hoop presents when it is rolling directly away from
me. I may now frame the idea of a mathematical circle, in which all
diameters are precisely equal, in express contrast to the series of
ellipses, with very unequal diameters, which the floundering hoop has
illustrated in its career. When once, however, the definition of the
circle is attained, no watching of hoops is any longer requisite. The
ellipse can be generated ideally out of the definition, and would have
been generated, <a name="Page_211" id="Page_211" />like asymptotes and hyperbolas, even if never
illustrated in nature at all. Lemmas from a foreign tongue have only
served to disclose a great fecundity in the native one, and the
legitimate word that the context required has supplanted the casual
stranger that may first have ushered it into the mind.</p>

<p>When the idea which dialectic is to elaborate is a moral idea, a purpose
touching something in the concrete world, lemmas from experience often
play a very large part in the process. Their multitude, with the small
shifts in aspiration and esteem which they may suggest to the mind,
often obscures the dialectical process altogether. In this case the
foreign term is never translated into the native medium; we never make
out what ideal connection our conclusion has with our premises, nor in
what way the conduct we finally decide upon is to fulfil the purpose
with which we began. Reflection merely beats about the bush, and when a
sufficient number of prejudices and impulses have been driven from
cover, we go home satisfied with our day's ranging, and feeling that we
have left no duty unconsidered; and our last bird is our final
resolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrested rationality in morals.</div>

<p>When morality is in this way non-dialectical, casual, impulsive,
polyglot, it is what we may call prerational morality. There is indeed
reason in it, since every deliberate precept expresses some reflection
by which impulses have been compared and modi<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212" />fied. But such chance
reflection amounts to moral perception, not to moral science. Reason has
not begun to educate her children. This morality is like knowing chairs
from tables and things near from distant things, which is hardly what we
mean by natural science. On this stage, in the moral world, are the
judgments of Mrs. Grundy, the aims of political parties and their
maxims, the principles of war, the appreciation of art, the commandments
of religious authorities, special revelations of duty to individuals,
and all systems of intuitive ethics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its emotional and practical power.</div>

<p>Prerational morality is vigorous because it is sincere. Actual
interests, rooted habits, appreciations the opposite of which is
inconceivable and contrary to the current use of language, are embodied
in special precepts; or they flare up of themselves in impassioned
judgments. It is hardly too much to say, indeed, that prerational
morality is morality proper. Rational ethics, in comparison, seems a
kind of politics or wisdom, while post-rational systems are essentially
religions. If we thus identify morality with prerational standards, we
may agree also that morality is no science in itself, though it may
become, with other matters, a subject for the science of anthropology;
and Hume, who had never come to close quarters with any rational or
post-rational ideal, could say with perfect truth that morality was not
founded on reason. Instinct is of course not founded on rea<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213" />son, but
<i>vice versa</i>; and the maxims enforced by tradition or conscience are
unmistakably founded on instinct. They might, it is true, become
materials for reason, if they were intelligently accepted, compared, and
controlled; but such a possibility reverses the partisan and spasmodic
methods which Hume and most other professed moralists associate with
ethics. Hume's own treatises on morals, it need hardly be said, are pure
psychology. It would have seemed to him conceited, perhaps, to inquire
what ought really to be done. He limited himself to asking what men
tended to think about their doings.</p>

<p>The chief expression of rational ethics which a man in Hume's world
would have come upon lay in the Platonic and Aristotelian writings; but
these were not then particularly studied nor vitally understood. The
chief illustration of post-rational morality that could have fallen
under his eyes, the Catholic religion, he would never have thought of as
a philosophy of life, but merely as a combination of superstition and
policy, well adapted to the lying and lascivious habits of Mediterranean
peoples. Under such circumstances ethics could not be thought of as a
science; and whatever gradual definition of the ideal, whatever
prescription of what ought to be and to be done, found a place in the
thoughts of such philosophers formed a part of their politics or
religion and not of their reasoned knowledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral science is an application of dialectic, not a part of
anthropology.</div>

<p>There is, however, a dialectic of the will; and <a name="Page_214" id="Page_214" />that is the science
which, for want of a better name, we must call ethics or moral
philosophy. The interweaving of this logic of practice with various
natural sciences that have man or society for their theme, leads to much
confusion in terminology and in point of view. Is the good, we may ask,
what anybody calls good at any moment, or what anybody calls good on
reflection, or what all men agree to call good, or what God calls good,
no matter what all mankind may think about it? Or is true good something
that perhaps nobody calls good nor knows of, something with no other
characteristic or relation except that it is simply good?</p>

<p>Various questions are involved in such perplexing alternatives; some are
physical questions and others dialectical. Why any one values anything
at all, or anything in particular, is a question of physics; it asks for
the causes of interest, judgment, and desire. To esteem a thing good is
to express certain affinities between that thing and the speaker; and if
this is done with self-knowledge and with knowledge of the thing, so
that the felt affinity is a real one, the judgment is invulnerable and
cannot be asked to rescind itself. Thus if a man said hemlock was good
to drink, we might say he was mistaken; but if he explained that he
meant good to drink in committing suicide, there would be nothing
pertinent left to say: for to adduce that to commit suicide is not good
would <a name="Page_215" id="Page_215" />be impertinent. To establish that, we should have to go back and
ask him if he valued anything&mdash;life, parents, country, knowledge,
reputation; and if he said no, and was sincere, our mouths would be
effectually stopped&mdash;that is, unless we took to declamation. But we
might very well turn to the bystanders and explain what sort of blood
and training this man possessed, and what had happened among the cells
and fibres of his brain to make him reason after that fashion. The
causes of morality, good or bad, are physical, seeing that they are
causes.</p>

<p>The science of ethics, however, has nothing to do with causes, not in
that it need deny or ignore them but in that it is their fruit and
begins where they end. Incense rises from burning coals, but it is
itself no conflagration, and will produce none. What ethics asks is not
why a thing is called good, but whether it is good or not, whether it is
right or not so to esteem it. Goodness, in this ideal sense, is not a
matter of opinion, but of nature. For intent is at work, life is in
active operation, and the question is whether the thing or the situation
responds to that intent. So if I ask, Is four really twice two? the
answer is not that most people say so, but that, in saying so, I am not
misunderstanding myself. To judge whether things are <i>really</i> good,
intent must be made to speak; and if this intent may itself be judged
later, that happens by virtue of other intents comparing the first with
their own direction.</p>

<p><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216" />Hence good, when once the moral or dialectical attitude has been
assumed, means not what is called good but what is so; that is, what
<i>ought</i> to be called good. For intent, beneath which there is no moral
judgment, sets up its own standard, and ideal science begins on that
basis, and cannot go back of it to ask why the obvious good is good at
all. Naturally, there is a reason, but not a moral one; for it lies in
the physical habit and necessity of things. The reason is simply the
propulsive essence of animals and of the universal flux, which renders
forms possible but unstable, and either helpful or hurtful to one
another. That nature should have this constitution, or intent this
direction, is not a good in itself. It is esteemed good or bad as the
intent that speaks finds in that situation a support or an obstacle to
its ideal. As a matter of fact, nature and the very existence of life
cannot be thought wholly evil, since no intent is wholly at war with
these its conditions; nor can nature and life be sincerely regarded as
wholly good, since no moral intent stops at the facts; nor does the
universal flux, which infinitely overflows any actual synthesis,
altogether support any intent it may generate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Estimation the soul of philosophy.</div>

<p>Philosophers would do a great discourtesy to estimation if they sought
to justify it. It is all other acts that need justification by this one.
The good greets us initially in every experience and in every object.
Remove from anything its share of excel<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217" />lence and you have made it
utterly insignificant, irrelevant to human discourse, and unworthy of
even theoretic consideration. Value is the principle of perspective in
science, no less than of rightness in life. The hierarchy of goods, the
architecture of values, is the subject that concerns man most. Wisdom is
the first philosophy, both in time and in authority; and to collect
facts or to chop logic would be idle and would add no dignity to the
mind, unless that mind possessed a clear humanity and could discern what
facts and logic are good for and what not. The facts would remain facts
and the truths truths; for of course values, accruing on account of
animal souls and their affections, cannot possibly create the universe
those animals inhabit. But both facts and truths would remain trivial,
fit to awaken no pang, no interest, and no rapture. The first
philosophers were accordingly sages. They were statesmen and poets who
knew the world and cast a speculative glance at the heavens, the better
to understand the conditions and limits of human happiness. Before their
day, too, wisdom had spoken in proverbs. <i>It is better</i> every adage
began: <i>Better this than that</i>. Images or symbols, mythical or homely
events, of course furnished subjects and provocations for these
judgments; but the residuum of all observation was a settled estimation
of things, a direction chosen in thought and life because it was better.
Such was philosophy in the beginning and such is philosophy still.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218" />Moral discriminations are natural and inevitable.</div>

<p>To one brought up in a sophisticated society, or in particular under an
ethical religion morality seems at first an external command, a chilling
and arbitrary set of requirements and prohibitions which the young
heart, if it trusted itself, would not reckon at a penny's worth. Yet
while this rebellion is brewing in the secret conclave of the passions,
the passions themselves are prescribing a code. They are inventing
gallantry and kindness and honour; they are discovering friendship and
paternity. With maturity comes the recognition that the authorised
precepts of morality were essentially not arbitrary; that they expressed
the genuine aims and interests of a practised will; that their alleged
alien and supernatural basis (which if real would have deprived them of
all moral authority) was but a mythical cover for their forgotten
natural springs. Virtue is then seen to be admirable essentially, and
not merely by conventional imputation. If traditional morality has much
in it that is out of proportion, much that is unintelligent and inert,
nevertheless it represents on the whole the verdict of reason. It speaks
for a typical human will chastened by a typical human experience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A choice of proverbs.</div>

<p>Gnomic wisdom, however, is notoriously polychrome, and proverbs depend
for their truth entirely on the occasion they are applied to. Almost
every wise saying has an opposite one, no less wise, to balance it; so
that a <a name="Page_219" id="Page_219" />man rich in such lore, like Sancho Panza, can always find a
venerable maxim to fortify the view he happens to be taking. In respect
to foresight, for instance, we are told, Make hay while the sun shines,
A stitch in time saves nine, Honesty is the best policy, Murder will
out, Woe unto you, ye hypocrites, Watch and pray, Seek salvation with
fear and trembling, and <i>Respice finem</i>. But on the same authorities
exactly we have opposite maxims, inspired by a feeling that mortal
prudence is fallible, that life is shorter than policy, and that only
the present is real; for we hear, A bird in the hand is worth two in the
bush, <i>Carpe diem, Ars longa, vita brevis</i>. Be not righteous overmuch,
Enough for the day is the evil thereof, Behold the lilies of the field,
Judge not, that ye be not judged, Mind your own business, and It takes
all sorts of men to make a world. So when some particularly shocking
thing happens one man says, <i>Cherchez la femme</i>, and another says, Great
is Allah.</p>

<p>That these maxims should be so various and partial is quite intelligible
when we consider how they spring up. Every man, in moral reflection, is
animated by his own intent; he has something in view which he prizes, he
knows not why, and which wears to him the essential and unquestionable
character of a good. With this standard before his eyes, he observes
easily&mdash;for love and hope are extraordinarily keen-sighted&mdash;what in
action or in circumstances forwards his purpose <a name="Page_220" id="Page_220" />and what thwarts it;
and at once the maxim comes, very likely in the language of the
particular instance before him. Now the interests that speak in a man
are different at different times; and the outer facts or measures which
in one case promote that interest may, where other less obvious
conditions have changed, altogether defeat it. Hence all sorts of
precepts looking to all sorts of results.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their various representative value.</div>

<p>Prescriptions of this nature differ enormously in value; for they differ
enormously in scope. By chance, or through the insensible operation of
experience leading up to some outburst of genius, intuitive maxims may
be so central, so expressive of ultimate aims, so representative, I
mean, of all aims in fusion, that they merely anticipate what moral
science would have come to if it had existed. This happens much as in
physics ultimate truths may be divined by poets long before they are
discovered by investigators; the <i>vivida vis animi</i> taking the place of
much recorded experience, because much unrecorded experience has
secretly fed it. Such, for instance, is the central maxim of
Christianity, Love thy neighbour as thyself. On the other hand, what is
usual in intuitive codes is a mixture of some elementary precepts,
necessary to any society, with others representing local traditions or
ancient rites: so Thou shalt not kill, and Thou shalt keep holy the
Sabbath day, figure side by side in the Decalogue. When Antig<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221" />one, in
her sublimest exaltation, defies human enactments and appeals to laws
which are not of to-day nor yesterday, no man knowing whence they have
arisen, she mixes various types of obligation in a most instructive
fashion; for a superstitious horror at leaving a body
unburied&mdash;something decidedly of yesterday&mdash;gives poignancy in her mind
to natural affection for a brother&mdash;something indeed universal, yet
having a well-known origin. The passionate assertion of right is here,
in consequence, more dramatic than spiritual; and even its dramatic
force has suffered somewhat by the change in ruling ideals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conflict of partial moralities.</div>

<p>The disarray of intuitive ethics is made painfully clear in the
conflicts which it involves when it has fostered two incompatible
growths in two centres which lie near enough to each other to come into
physical collision. Such ethics has nothing to offer in the presence of
discord except an appeal to force and to ultimate physical sanctions. It
can instigate, but cannot resolve, the battle of nations and the battle
of religions. Precisely the same zeal, the same patriotism, the same
readiness for martyrdom fires adherents to rival societies, and fires
them especially in view of the fact that the adversary is no less
uncompromising and fierce. It might seem idle, if not cruel and
malicious, to wish to substitute one historical allegiance for another,
when both are equally arbitrary, and the existing one is the more
congenial <a name="Page_222" id="Page_222" />to those born under it; but to feel this aggression to be
criminal demands some degree of imagination and justice, and sectaries
would not be sectaries if they possessed it.</p>

<p>Truly religious minds, while eager perhaps to extirpate every religion
but their own, often rise above national jealousies; for spirituality is
universal, whatever churches may be. Similarly politicians often
understand very well the religious situation; and of late it has become
again the general practice among prudent governments to do as the Romans
did in their conquests, and to leave people free to exercise what
religion they have, without pestering them with a foreign one. On the
other hand the same politicians are the avowed agents of a quite patent
iniquity; for what is their ideal? To substitute their own language,
commerce, soldiers, and tax-gatherers for the tax-gatherers, soldiers,
commerce, and language of their neighbours; and no means is thought
illegitimate, be it fraud in policy or bloodshed in war, to secure this
absolutely nugatory end. Is not one country as much a country as
another? Is it not as dear to its inhabitants? What then is gained by
oppressing its genius or by seeking to destroy it altogether?</p>

<p>Here are two flagrant instances where prerational morality defeats the
ends of morality. Viewed from within, each religious or national
fanaticism stands for a good; but in its outward operation it produces
and becomes an evil. It is <a name="Page_223" id="Page_223" />possible, no doubt, that its agents are
really so far apart in nature and ideals that, like men and mosquitoes,
they can stand in physical relations only, and if they meet can meet
only to poison or to crush one another. More probably, however, humanity
in them is no merely nominal essence; it is definable ideally, as
essences are defined, by a partially identical function and intent. In
that case, by studying their own nature, they could rise above their
mutual opposition, and feel that in their fanaticism they were taking
too contracted a view of their own souls and were hardly doing justice
to themselves when they did such great injustice to others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Greek ideal.</div>

<p>How prerational morality may approach the goal, and miss it, is well
illustrated in the history of Hellenism. Greek morals may be said to
have been inspired by two prerational sentiments, a naturalistic
religion and a local patriotism. Could Plato have succeeded in making
that religion moral, or Alexander in universalising that patriotism,
perhaps Greece might have been saved and we might all be now at a very
different level of civilisation. Both Plato and Alexander failed, in
spite of the immense and lasting influence of their work; for in both
cases the after-effects were spurious, and the new spirit was smothered
in the dull substances it strove to vivify.</p>

<p>Greek myth was an exuberant assertion of the rights of life in the
universe. Existence could <a name="Page_224" id="Page_224" />not but be joyful and immortal, if it had
once found, in land, sea, or air, a form congruous with that element.
Such congruity would render a being stable, efficient, beautiful. He
would achieve a perfection grounded in skilful practice and in a
thorough rejection of whatever was irrelevant. These things the Greeks
called virtue. The gods were perfect models of this kind of excellence;
for of course the amours of Zeus and Hermes' trickery were, in their
hearty fashion, splendid manifestations of energy. This natural divine
virtue carried no sense of responsibility with it, but it could not fail
to diffuse benefit because it radiated happiness and beauty. The
worshipper, by invoking those braver inhabitants of the cosmos, felt he
might more easily attain a corresponding beauty and happiness in his
paternal city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Imaginative exuberance and political discipline.</div>

<p>The source of myth had been a genial sympathy with nature. The observer,
at ease himself, multiplied ideally the potentialities of his being; but
he went farther in imagining what life might yield abroad, freed from
every trammel and necessity, than in deepening his sense of what life
was in himself, and of what it ought to be. This moral reflection,
absent from mythology, was supplied by politics. The family and the
state had a soberer antique religion of their own; this hereditary
piety, together with the laws, prescribed education, customs, and
duties. The city drew its <a name="Page_225" id="Page_225" />walls close about the heart, and while it
fostered friendship and reason within, without it looked to little but
war. A splendid physical and moral discipline was established to serve a
suicidal egoism. The city committed its crimes, and the individual
indulged his vices of conduct and estimation, hardly rebuked by
philosophy and quite unrebuked by religion. Nevertheless, religion and
philosophy existed, together with an incomparable literature and art,
and an unrivalled measure and simplicity in living. A liberal fancy and
a strict civic regimen, starting with different partial motives and
blind purposes, combined by good fortune into an almost rational life.</p>

<p>It was inevitable, however, when only an irrational tradition supported
the state, and kept it so weak amid a world of enemies, that this state
should succumb; not to speak of the mean animosities, the license in
life, and the spirit of mockery that inwardly infested it. The myths,
too, faded; they had expressed a fleeting moment of poetic insight, as
patriotism had expressed a fleeting moment of unanimous effort; but what
force could sustain such accidental harmonies? The patriotism soon lost
its power to inspire sacrifice, and the myth its power to inspire
wonder; so that the relics of that singular civilisation were scattered
almost at once in the general flood of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sterility of Greek example.</div>

<p>The Greek ideal has fascinated many men in all ages, who have sometimes
been in a position <a name="Page_226" id="Page_226" />to set a fashion, so that the world in general has
pretended also to admire. But the truth is Hellas, in leaving so many
heirlooms to mankind, has left no constitutional benefit; it has taught
the conscience no lesson. We possess a great heritage from Greece, but
it is no natural endowment. An artistic renaissance in the fifteenth
century and a historical one in the nineteenth have only affected the
trappings of society. The movement has come from above. It has not found
any response in the people. While Greek morality, in its contents or in
the type of life it prescribes, comes nearer than any other prerational
experiment to what reason might propose, yet it has been less useful
than many other influences in bringing the Life of Reason about. The
Christian and the Moslem, in refining their more violent inspiration,
have brought us nearer to genuine goodness than the Greek could by his
idle example. Classic perfection is a seedless flower, imitable only by
artifice, not reproducible by generation. It is capable of influencing
character only through the intellect, the means by which character can
be influenced least. It is a detached ideal, responding to no crying and
actual demand in the world at large. It never passed, to win the right
of addressing mankind, through a sufficient novitiate of sorrow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prerational morality among the Jews.</div>

<p>The Hebrews, on the contrary, who in comparison with the Greeks had a
barbarous idea of hap<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227" />piness, showed far greater moral cohesion under
the pressure of adversity. They integrated their purposes into a
fanaticism, but they integrated them; and the integrity that resulted
became a mighty example. It constituted an ideal of character not the
less awe-inspiring for being merely formal. We need not marvel that
abstract commandments should have impressed the world more than concrete
ideals. To appreciate an ideal, to love and serve it in the full light
of science and reason, would require a high intelligence, and, what is
rarer still, noble affinities and renunciations which are not to be
looked for in an undisciplined people. But to feel the truth and
authority of an abstract maxim (as, for instance, Do right and shame the
devil), a maxim applicable to experience on any plane, nothing is needed
but a sound wit and common honesty. Men know better what is right and
wrong than what is ultimately good or evil; their conscience is more
vividly present to them than the fruits which obedience to conscience
might bear; so that the logical relation of means to ends, of methods to
activities, eludes them altogether. What is a necessary connection
between the given end, happiness, and the normal life naturally
possessing it, appears to them as a miraculous connection between
obedience to God's commands and enjoyment of his favour. The evidence of
this miracle astonishes them and fills them with zeal. They are
strengthened to per<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228" />severe in righteousness under any stress of
misfortune, in the assurance that they are being put to a temporary test
and that the reward promised to virtue will eventually be theirs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The development of conscience.</div>

<p>Thus a habit of faithfulness, a trust in general principles, is fostered
and ingrained in generation after generation&mdash;a rare and precious
heritage for a race so imperfectly rational as the human. Reason would
of course justify the same constancy in well-doing, since a course of
conduct would not be right, but wrong, if its ultimate issue were human
misery. But as the happiness secured by virtue may be remote and may
demand more virtue to make it appreciable, the mere rationality of a
habit gives it no currency in the world and but little moral glow in the
conscience. We should not, therefore, be too much offended at the
illusions which play a part in moral integration. Imagination is often
more efficacious in reaching the gist and meaning of experience than
intelligence can be, just because imagination is less scrupulous and
more instinctive. Even physical discoveries, when they come, are the
fruit of divination, and Columbus had to believe he might sail westward
to India before he could actually hit upon America. Reason cannot create
itself, and nature, in producing reason, has to feel her way
experimentally. Habits and chance systems of education have to arise
first and exercise upon individuals an irrational suasion favourable to
rational ends. Men long live in <a name="Page_229" id="Page_229" />substantial harmony with reality before
they recognise its nature. Organs long exist before they reach their
perfect function. The fortunate instincts of a race destined to long
life and rationality express themselves in significant poetry before
they express themselves in science.</p>

<p>The service which Hebraism has rendered to mankind has been
instrumental, as that rendered by Hellenism has been imaginative.
Hebraism has put earnestness and urgency into morality, making it a
matter of duty, at once private and universal, rather than what paganism
had left it, a mass of local allegiances and legal practices. The Jewish
system has, in consequence, a tendency to propaganda and intolerance; a
tendency which would not have proved nefarious had this religion always
remained true to its moral principle; for morality is coercive and no
man, being autonomous, has a right to do wrong. Conscience, thus
reinforced by religious passion, has been able to focus a general
abhorrence on certain great scandals&mdash;slavery and sodomy could be
practically suppressed among Christians, and drunkenness among Moslems.
The Christian principle of charity also owed a part of its force to
Hebraic tradition. For the law and the prophets were full of mercy and
loving kindness toward the faithful. What Moses had taught his people
Christ and his Hellenising disciples had the beautiful courage to preach
to all mankind. Yet this virtue of charity, on its subtler and more
<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230" />metaphysical side, belongs to the spirit of redemption, to that ascetic
and quasi-Buddhistic element in Christianity to which we shall presently
revert. The pure Jews can have no part in such insight, because it
contradicts the positivism of their religion and character and their
ideal of worldly happiness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Need of Hebraic devotion to Greek aims.</div>

<p>As the human body is said to change all its substance every seven years,
and yet is the same body, so the Hebraic conscience might change all its
tenets in seven generations and be the same conscience still. Could this
abstract moral habit, this transferable earnestness, be enlisted in
rational causes, the Life of Reason would have gained a valuable
instrument. Men would possess the &quot;single eye,&quot; and the art, so
difficult to an ape-like creature with loose moral feelings, of acting
on principle. Could the vision of an adequate natural ideal fall into
the Hebraising mind, already aching for action and nerved to practical
enthusiasm, that ideal vision might become efficacious and be largely
realised in practice. The abstract power of self-direction, if
enlightened by a larger experience and a more fertile genius, might give
the Life of Reason a public embodiment such as it has not had since the
best days of classic antiquity. Thus the two prerational moralities out
of which European civilisation has grown, could they be happily
superposed, would make a rational polity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231" />Prerational morality marks an acquisition but offers no
programme.</div>

<p>The objects of human desire, then, until reason has compared and
experience has tested them, are a miscellaneous assortment of goods,
unstable in themselves and incompatible with one another. It is a happy
chance if a tolerable mixture of them recommends itself to a prophet or
finds an adventitous acceptance among a group of men. Intuitive morality
is adequate while it simply enforces those obvious and universal laws
which are indispensable to any society, and which impose themselves
everywhere on men under pain of quick extinction&mdash;a penalty which many
an individual and many a nation continually prefers to pay. But when
intuitive morality ventures upon speculative ground and tries to guide
progress, its magic fails. Ideals are tentative and have to be
critically viewed. A moralist who rests in his intuitions may be a good
preacher, but hardly deserves the name of philosopher. He cannot find
any authority for his maxims which opposite maxims may not equally
invoke. To settle the relative merits of rival authorities and of
hostile consciences it is necessary to appeal to the only real
authority, to experience, reason, and human nature in the living man. No
other test is conceivable and no other would be valid; for no good man
would ever consent to regard an authority as divine or binding which
essentially contradicted his own conscience. Yet a conscience which is
irreflective and incorrigible is too hastily <a name="Page_232" id="Page_232" />satisfied with itself, and
not conscientious enough: it needs cultivation by dialectic. It neglects
to extend to all human interests that principle of synthesis and justice
by which conscience itself has arisen. And so soon as the conscience
summons its own dicta for revision in the light of experience and of
universal sympathy, it is no longer called conscience, but reason. So,
too, when the spirit summons its traditional faiths, to subject them to
a similar examination, that exercise is not called religion, but
philosophy. It is true, in a sense, that philosophy is the purest
religion and reason the ultimate conscience; but so to name them would
be misleading. The things commonly called by those names have seldom
consented to live at peace with sincere reflection. It has been felt
vaguely that reason could not have produced them, and that they might
suffer sad changes by submitting to it; as if reason could be the
<i>ground</i> of anything, or as if everything might not find its
consummation in becoming rational.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>RATIONAL ETHICS</p>


<div class="sidenote">Moral passions represent private interests.</div>


<p>In moral reprobation there is often a fanatical element, I mean that
hatred which an animal may sometimes feel for other animals on account
of their strange aspect, or because their habits put him to serious
inconvenience, or because these habits, if he himself adopted them,
might be vicious in him. Such aversion, however, is not a rational
sentiment. No fault can be justly found with a creature merely for not
resembling another, or for nourishing in a different physical or moral
environment. It has been an unfortunate consequence of mythical
philosophies that moral emotions have been stretched to objects with
which a man has only physical relations, so that the universe has been
filled with monsters more or less horrible, according as the forces they
represented were more or less formidable to human life. In the same
spirit, every experiment in civilisation has passed for a crime among
those engaged in some other experiment. The foreigner has seemed an
insidious rascal, the heretic a pestilent sinner, and any material
ob<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234" />stacle a literal devil; while to possess some unusual passion,
however innocent, has brought obloquy on every one unfortunate enough
not to be constituted like the average of his neighbours.</p>

<p>Ethics, if it is to be a science and not a piece of arbitrary
legislation, cannot pronounce it sinful in a serpent to be a serpent; it
cannot even accuse a barbarian of loving a wrong life, except in so far
as the barbarian is supposed capable of accusing himself of barbarism.
If he is a perfect barbarian he will be inwardly, and therefore morally,
justified. The notion of a barbarian will then be accepted by him as
that of a true man, and will form the basis of whatever rational
judgments or policy he attains. It may still seem dreadful to him to be
a serpent, as to be a barbarian might seem dreadful to a man imbued with
liberal interests. But the degree to which moral science, or the
dialectic of will, can condemn any type of life depends on the amount of
disruptive contradiction which, at any reflective moment, that life
brings under the unity of apperception. The discordant impulses therein
confronted will challenge and condemn one another; and the court of
reason in which their quarrel is ventilated will have authority to
pronounce between them.</p>

<p>The physical repulsion, however, which everybody feels to habits and
interests which he is incapable of sharing is no part of rational
estimation, large as its share may be in the fierce preju<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235" />dices and
superstitions which prerational morality abounds in. The strongest
feelings assigned to the conscience are not moral feelings at all; they
express merely physical antipathies.</p>

<p>Toward alien powers a man's true weapon is not invective, but skill and
strength. An obstacle is an obstacle, not a devil; and even a moral
life, when it actually exists in a being with hostile activities, is
merely a hostile power. It is not hostile, however, in so far as it is
moral, but only in so far as its morality represents a material
organism, physically incompatible with what the thinker has at heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Common ideal interests may supervene.</div>

<p>Material conflicts cannot be abolished by reason, because reason is
powerful only where they have been removed. Yet where opposing forces
are able mutually to comprehend and respect one another, common ideal
interests at once supervene, and though the material conflict may remain
irrepressible, it will be overlaid by an intellectual life, partly
common and unanimous. In this lies the chivalry of war, that we
acknowledge the right of others to pursue ends contrary to our own.
Competitors who are able to feel this ideal comity, and who leading
different lives in the flesh lead the same life in imagination, are
incited by their mutual understanding to rise above that material
ambition, perhaps gratuitous, that has made them enemies. They may
ultimately wish to renounce that temporal good which de<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236" />prives them of
spiritual goods in truth infinitely greater and more appealing to the
soul&mdash;innocence, justice, and intelligence. They may prefer an enlarged
mind to enlarged frontiers, and the comprehension of things foreign to
the destruction of them. They may even aspire to detachment from those
private interests which, as Plato said,<a name="FNanchor_A_8" id="FNanchor_A_8" /><a href="#Footnote_A_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> do not deserve to be taken
too seriously; the fact that we must take them seriously being the
ignoble part of our condition.</p>

<p>Of course such renunciations, to be rational, must not extend to the
whole material basis of life, since some physical particularity and
efficiency are requisite for bringing into being that very rationality
which is to turn enemies into friends. The need of a material basis for
spirit is what renders partial war with parts of the world the
inevitable background of charity and justice. The frontiers at which
this warfare is waged may, however, be pushed back indefinitely. Within
the sphere organised about a firm and generous life a Roman peace can be
established. It is not what is assimilated that saps a creative will,
but what remains outside that ultimately invades and disrupts it. In
exact proportion to its vigour, it wins over former enemies, civilises
the barbarian, and even tames the viper, when the eye is masterful and
sympathetic enough to dispel hatred and fear. The more rational an
institution is the less it suffers by making conces<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237" />sions to others; for
these concessions, being just, propagate its essence. The ideal
commonwealth can extend to the limit at which such concessions cease to
be just and are thereby detrimental. Beyond or below that limit strife
must continue for physical ascendancy, so that the power and the will to
be reasonable may not be undermined. Reason is an operation in nature,
and has its root there. Saints cannot arise where there have been no
warriors, nor philosophers where a prying beast does not remain hidden
in the depths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To this extent there is rational society.</div>

<p>Perhaps the art of politics, if it were practised scientifically, might
obviate open war, religious enmities, industrial competition, and human
slavery; but it would certainly not leave a free field for all animals
nor for all monstrosities in men. Even while admitting the claims of
monsters to be treated humanely, reason could not suffer them to absorb
those material resources which might be needed to maintain rational
society at its highest efficiency. We cannot, at this immense distance
from a rational social order, judge what concessions individual genius
would be called upon to make in a system of education and government in
which all attainable goods should be pursued scientifically. Concessions
would certainly be demanded, if not from well-trained wills, still from
inevitable instincts, reacting on inevitable accidents. There is tragedy
in perfection, because the universe in which perfec<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238" />tion arises is
itself imperfect. Accidents will always continue to harass the most
consummate organism; they will flow in both from the outer world and
from the interstices, so to speak, of its own machinery; for a rational
life touches the irrational at its core as well as at its periphery. In
both directions it meets physical force and can subsist only by
exercising physical force in return. The range of rational ethics is
limited to the intermediate political zone, in which existences have
attained some degree of natural unanimity.</p>

<p>It should be added, perhaps, that the frontiers between moral and
physical action are purely notional. Real existences do not lie wholly
on one or the other side of them. Every man, every material object, has
moral affinities enveloping an indomitable vital nucleus or brute
personal kernel; this moral essence is enveloped in turn by untraceable
relations, radiating to infinity over the natural world. The stars enter
society by the light and knowledge they afford, the time they keep, and
the ornament they lavish; but they are mere dead weights in their
substance and cosmological puzzles in their destiny. You and I possess
manifold ideal bonds in the interests we share; but each of us has his
poor body and his irremediable, incommunicable dreams. Beyond the little
span of his foresight and love, each is merely a physical agency,
preparing the way quite irresponsibly for undreamt-of revolutions and
alien lives.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239" />A rational morality not attainable,</div>

<p>A truly rational morality, or social regimen, has never existed in the
world and is hardly to be looked for. What guides men and nations in
their practice is always some partial interest or some partial
disillusion. A rational morality would imply perfect self-knowledge, so
that no congenial good should be needlessly missed&mdash;least of all
practical reason or justice itself; so that no good congenial to other
creatures would be needlessly taken from them. The total value which
everything had from the agent's point of view would need to be
determined and felt efficaciously; and, among other things, the total
value which this point of view, with the conduct it justified, would
have for every foreign interest which it affected. Such knowledge, such
definition of purpose, and such perfection of sympathy are clearly
beyond man's reach. All that can be hoped for is that the advance of
science and commerce, by fostering peace and a rational development of
character, may bring some part of mankind nearer to that goal; but the
goal lies, as every ultimate ideal should, at the limit of what is
possible, and must serve rather to measure achievements than to prophesy
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">but its principle clear.</div>

<p>In lieu of a rational morality,
however, we have rational ethics; and this mere idea of a rational
morality is something valuable. While we wait for the sentiments,
customs, and laws which should embody <a name="Page_240" id="Page_240" />perfect humanity and perfect
justice, we may observe the germinal principle of these ideal things; we
may sketch the ground-plan of a true commonwealth. This sketch
constitutes rational ethics, as founded by Socrates, glorified by Plato,
and sobered and solidified by Aristotle. It sets forth the method of
judgment and estimation which a rational morality would apply
universally and express in practice. The method, being very simple, can
be discovered and largely illustrated in advance, while the complete
self-knowledge and sympathy are still wanting which might avail to
embody that method in the concrete and to discover unequivocally where
absolute duty and ultimate happiness may lie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is the logic of an autonomous will.</div>

<p>This method, the Socratic method, consists in accepting any estimation
which any man may sincerely make, and in applying dialectic to it, so as
to let the man see what he really esteems. What he really esteems is
what ought to guide his conduct; for to suggest that a rational being
ought to do what he feels to be wrong, or ought to pursue what he
genuinely thinks is worthless, would be to impugn that man's rationality
and to discredit one's own. With what face could any man or god say to
another: Your duty is to do what you cannot know you ought to do; your
function is to suffer what you cannot recognise to be worth suffering?
Such an attitude amounts to imposture and excludes society; it is the
attitude of a <a name="Page_241" id="Page_241" />detestable tyrant, and any one who mistakes it for moral
authority has not yet felt the first heart-throb of philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Socrates' science.</div>

<p>More even than natural philosophy, moral philosophy is something Greek:
it is the appanage of freemen. The Socratic method is the soul of
liberal conversation; it is compacted in equal measure of sincerity and
courtesy. Each man is autonomous and all are respected; and nothing is
brought forward except to be submitted to reason and accepted or
rejected by the self-questioning heart. Indeed, when Socrates appeared
in Athens mutual respect had passed into democracy and liberty into
license; but the stalwart virtue of Socrates saved him from being a
sophist, much as his method, when not honestly and sincerely used, might
seem to countenance that moral anarchy which the sophists had expressed
in their irresponsible doctrines. Their sophistry did not consist in the
private <i>seat</i> which they assigned to judgment; for what judgment is
there that is not somebody's judgment at some moment? The sophism
consisted in ignoring the living moment's <i>intent</i>, and in suggesting
that no judgment could refer to anything ulterior, and therefore that no
judgment could be wrong: in other words that each man at each moment was
the theme and standard, as well as the seat, of his judgment.</p>

<p>Socrates escaped this folly by force of honesty, which is what saves
from folly in dialectic. <a name="Page_242" id="Page_242" />He built his whole science precisely on that
intent which the sophists ignored; he insisted that people should
declare sincerely what they meant and what they wanted; and on that
living rock he founded the persuasive and ideal sciences of logic and
ethics, the necessity of which lies all in free insight and in actual
will. This will and insight they render deliberate, profound,
unshakable, and consistent. Socrates, by his genial midwifery, helped
men to discover the truth and excellence to which they were naturally
addressed. This circumstance rendered his doctrine at once moral and
scientific; scientific because dialectical, moral because expressive of
personal and living aspirations. His ethics was not like what has since
passed under that name&mdash;a spurious physics, accompanied by commandments
and threats. It was a pliant and liberal expression of ideals, inwardly
grounded and spontaneously pursued. It was an exercise in
self-knowledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its opposition to sophistry and moral anarchy.</div>

<p>Socrates' liberality was that of a free man ready to maintain his will
and conscience, if need be, against the whole world. The sophists, on
the contrary, were sycophants in their scepticism, and having inwardly
abandoned the ideals of their race and nation&mdash;which Socrates defended
with his homely irony&mdash;they dealt out their miscellaneous knowledge, or
their talent in exposition, at the beck and for the convenience of
others. Their theory was that each man having a right <a name="Page_243" id="Page_243" />to pursue his own
aims, skilful thinkers might, for money, furnish any fellow-mortal with
instruments fitted to his purpose. Socrates, on the contrary, conceived
that each man, to achieve his aims must first learn to distinguish them
clearly; he demanded that rationality, in the form of an examination and
clarification of purposes, should precede any selection of external
instruments. For how should a man recognise anything useful unless he
first had established the end to be subserved and thereby recognised the
good? True science, then, was that which enabled a man to disentangle
and attain his natural good; and such a science is also the art of life
and the whole of virtue.</p>

<p>The autonomous moralist differs from the sophist or ethical sceptic in
this: that he retains his integrity. In vindicating his ideal he does
not recant his human nature. In asserting the initial right of every
impulse in others, he remains the spokesman of his own. Knowledge of the
world, courtesy, and fairness do not neutralise his positive life. He is
thoroughly sincere, as the sophist is not; for every man, while he
lives, embodies and enacts some special interest; and this truth, which
those who confound psychology with ethics may think destructive of all
authority in morals, is in fact what alone renders moral judgment
possible and respectable. If the sophist declares that what his nature
attaches him to is not &quot;really&quot; a good, because it would not be <a name="Page_244" id="Page_244" />a good,
perhaps, for a different creature, he is a false interpreter of his own
heart, and rather discreditably stultifies his honest feelings and
actions by those theoretical valuations which, in guise of a mystical
ethics, he gives out to the world. Socratic liberality, on the contrary,
is consistent with itself, as Spinozistic naturalism is also; for it
exercises that right of private judgment which it concedes to others,
and avowedly builds up the idea of the good on that natural inner
foundation on which everybody who has it at all must inevitably build
it. This functional good is accordingly always relative and good for
something; it is the ideal which a vital and energising soul carries
with it as it moves. It is identical, as Socrates constantly taught,
with the useful, the helpful, the beneficent. It is the complement
needed to perfect every art and every activity after its own kind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its vitality</div>

<p>Rational ethics is an embodiment of volition, not a description of it.
It is the expression of living interest, preference, and categorical
choice. It leaves to psychology and history a free field for the
description of moral phenomena. It has no interest in slipping
far-fetched and incredible myths beneath the facts of nature, so as to
lend a non-natural origin to human aspirations. It even recognises, as
an emanation of its own force, that uncompromising truthfulness with
which science assigns all forms of moral life to their place in the
mechanical sys<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245" />tem of nature. But the rational moralist is not on that
account reduced to a mere spectator, a physicist acknowledging no
interest except the interest in facts and in the laws of change. His own
spirit, small by the material forces which it may stand for and express,
is great by its prerogative of surveying and judging the universe;
surveying it, of course, from a mortal point of view, and judging it
only by its kindliness or cruelty to some actual interest, yet, even so,
determining unequivocally a part of its constitution and excellence. The
rational moralist represents a force energising in the world,
discovering its affinities there and clinging to them to the exclusion
of their hateful opposites. He represents, over against the chance
facts, an ideal embodying the particular demands, possibilities, and
satisfactions of a specific being.</p>

<p>This dogmatic position of reason is not uncritically dogmatic; on the
contrary, it is the sophistical position that is uncritically neutral.
All criticism needs a dogmatic background, else it would lack objects
and criteria for criticism. The sophist himself, without confessing it,
enacts a special interest. He bubbles over with convictions about the
pathological and fatal origin of human beliefs, as if that could prevent
some of them from being more trustworthy and truer than others. He is
doubtless right in his psychology; his own ideas have their natural
causes and their chance of signifying something real. <a name="Page_246" id="Page_246" />His scepticism
may represent a wider experience than do the fanaticisms it opposes. But
this sceptic also lives. Nature has sent her saps abundantly into him,
and he cannot but nod dogmatically on that philosophical tree on which
he is so pungent a berry. His imagination is unmistakably fascinated by
the pictures it happens to put together. His judgment falls unabashed,
and his discourse splashes on in its dialectical march, every
stepping-stone an unquestioned idea, every stride a categorical
assertion. Does he deny this? Then his very denial, in its promptness
and heat, audibly contradicts him and makes him ridiculous. Honest
criticism consists in being consciously dogmatic, and conscientiously
so, like Descartes when he said, &quot;I am.&quot; It is to sift and harmonise all
assertions so as to make them a faithful expression of actual experience
and inevitable thought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genuine altruism is natural self-expression.</div>

<p>Now will, no less than that reason which avails to render will
consistent and far-reaching, animates natural bodies and expresses their
functions. It has a radical bias, a foregone, determinate direction,
else it could not be a will nor a principle of preference. The knowledge
of what other people desire does not abolish a man's own aims. Sympathy
and justice are simply an expansion of the soul's interests, arising
when we consider other men's lives so intently that something in us
imitates and re-enacts their experience, so that <a name="Page_247" id="Page_247" />we move partly in
unison with their movement, recognise the reality and initial legitimacy
of their interests, and consequently regard their aims in our action, in
so far as our own status and purposes have become identical with theirs.
We are not less ourselves, nor less autonomous, for this assimilation,
since we assimilate only what is in itself intelligible and congruous
with our mind and obey only that authority which can impose itself on
our reason.</p>

<p>The case is parallel to that of knowledge. To know all men's experience
and to comprehend their beliefs would constitute the most cogent and
settled of philosophies. Thought would then be reasonably adjusted to
all the facts of history, and judgment would grow more authoritative and
precise by virtue of that enlightenment. So, too, to understand all the
goods that any man, nay, that any beast or angel, may ever have pursued,
would leave man still necessitous of food, drink, sleep, and shelter; he
would still love; the comic, the loathsome, the beautiful would still
affect him with unmistakable direct emotions. His taste might no doubt
gain in elasticity by those sympathetic excursions into the polyglot
world; the plastic or dramatic quality which had enabled him to feel
other creatures' joys would grow by exercise and new overtones would be
added to his gamut. But the foundations of his nature would stand; and
his possible happiness, though some new and precious threads might be
woven <a name="Page_248" id="Page_248" />into it, would not have a texture fundamentally different.</p>

<p>The radical impulses at work in any animal must continue to speak while
he lives, for they are his essence. A true morality does not have to be
adopted; the parts of it best practised are those which are never
preached. To be &quot;converted&quot; would be to pass from one self-betrayal to
another. It would be to found a new morality on a new artifice. The
morality which has genuine authority exists inevitably and speaks
autonomously in every common judgment, self-congratulation, ambition, or
passion that fills the vulgar day. The pursuit of those goods which are
the only possible or fitting crown of a man's life is predetermined by
his nature; he cannot choose a law-giver, nor accept one, for none who
spoke to the purpose could teach him anything but to know himself.
Rational life is an art, not a slavery; and terrible as may be the
errors and the apathy that impede its successful exercise, the standard
and goal of it are given intrinsically. Any task imposed externally on a
man is imposed by force only, a force he has the right to defy so soon
as he can do so without creating some greater impediment to his natural
vocation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reason expresses impulses.</div>

<p>Rational ethics, then, resembles prerational precepts and half-systems
in being founded on impulse. It formulates a natural morality. It is a
settled method of achieving ends to which man is drawn <a name="Page_249" id="Page_249" />by virtue of his
physical and rational constitution. By this circumstance rational ethics
is removed from the bad company of all artificial, verbal, and unjust
systems of morality, which in absolving themselves from relevance to
man's endowment and experience merely show how completely irrelevant
they are to life. Once, no doubt, each of these arbitrary systems
expressed (like the observance of the Sabbath) some practical interest
or some not unnatural rite; but so narrow a basis of course has to be
disowned when the precepts so originating have been swollen into
universal tyrannical laws. A rational ethics reduces them at once to
their slender representative r&ocirc;le; and it surrounds and buttresses them
on every side with all other natural ideals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">but impulses reduced to harmony.</div>

<p>Rational ethics thus differs from the prerational in being complete.
There is one impulse which intuitive moralists ignore: the impulse to
reflect. Human instincts are ignorant, multitudinous, and contradictory.
To satisfy them as they come is often impossible, and often disastrous,
in that such satisfaction prevents the satisfaction of other instincts
inherently no less fecund and legitimate. When we apply reason to life
we immediately demand that life be consistent, complete, and
satisfactory when reflected upon and viewed as a whole. This view, as it
presents each moment in its relations, extends to all moments affected
by the action or maxim under discussion; it has <a name="Page_250" id="Page_250" />no more ground for
stopping at the limits of what is called a single life than at the
limits of a single adventure. To stop at selfishness is not particularly
rational. The same principle that creates the ideal of a self creates
the ideal of a family or an institution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Self-love artificial.</div>

<p>The conflict between selfishness and altruism is like that between any
two ideal passions that in some particular may chance to be opposed; but
such a conflict has no obstinate existence for reason. For reason the
person itself has no obstinate existence. The <i>character</i> which a man
achieves at the best moment of his life is indeed something ideal and
significant; it justifies and consecrates all his coherent actions and
preferences. But <i>the man's life</i>, the circle drawn by biographers
around the career of a particular body, from the womb to the
charnel-house, and around the mental flux that accompanies that career,
is no significant unity. All the substances and efficient processes that
figure within it come from elsewhere and continue beyond; while all the
rational objects and interests to which it refers have a trans-personal
status. Self-love itself is concerned with public opinion; and if a man
concentrates his view on private pleasures, these may qualify the
fleeting moments of his life with an intrinsic value, but they leave the
life itself shapeless and infinite, as if sparks should play over a
piece of burnt paper.</p>

<p><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251" />The limits assigned to the mass of sentience attributed to each man are
assigned conventionally; his prenatal feelings, his forgotten dreams,
and his unappropriated sensations belong to his body and for that reason
only are said to belong to him. Each impulse included within these
limits may be as directly compared with the represented impulses of
other people as with the represented impulses expected to arise later in
the same body. Reason lives among these represented values, all of which
have their cerebral seat and present efficacy over the passing thought;
and reason teaches this passing thought to believe in and to respect
them equally. Their right is not less clear, nor their influence less
natural, because they may range over the whole universe and may await
their realisation at the farthest boundaries of time. All that is
physically requisite to their operation is that they should be vividly
represented; while all that is requisite rationally, to justify them in
qualifying actual life by their influence, is that the present act
should have some tendency to bring the represented values about. In
other words, a rational mind would consider, in its judgment and action,
every interest which that judgment or action at all affected; and it
would conspire with each represented good in proportion, not to that
good's intrinsic importance, but to the power which the present act
might have of helping to realise that good.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sanction of reason is happiness.</div>

<p>If pleasure, because it is commonly a result of <a name="Page_252" id="Page_252" />satisfied instinct, may
by a figure of speech be called the aim of impulse, happiness, by a like
figure, may be called the aim of reason. The direct aim of reason is
harmony; yet harmony, when made to rule in life, gives reason a noble
satisfaction which we call happiness. Happiness is impossible and even
inconceivable to a mind without scope and without pause, a mind driven
by craving, pleasure, and fear. The moralists who speak disparagingly of
happiness are less sublime than they think. In truth their philosophy is
too lightly ballasted, too much fed on prejudice and quibbles, for
happiness to fall within its range. Happiness implies resource and
security; it can be achieved only by discipline. Your intuitive moralist
rejects discipline, at least discipline of the conscience; and he is
punished by having no lien on wisdom. He trusts to the clash of blind
forces in collision, being one of them himself. He demands that virtue
should be partisan and unjust; and he dreams of crushing the adversary
in some physical cataclysm.</p>

<p>Such groping enthusiasm is often innocent and romantic; it captivates us
with its youthful spell. But it has no structure with which to resist
the shocks of fortune, which it goes out so jauntily to meet. It turns
only too often into vulgarity and worldliness. A snow-flake is soon a
smudge, and there is a deeper purity in the diamond. Happiness is hidden
from a free and casual will; <a name="Page_253" id="Page_253" />it belongs rather to one chastened by a
long education and unfolded in an atmosphere of sacred and perfected
institutions. It is discipline that renders men rational and capable of
happiness, by suppressing without hatred what needs to be suppressed to
attain a beautiful naturalness. Discipline discredits the random
pleasures of illusion, hope, and triumph, and substitutes those which
are self-reproductive, perennial, and serene, because they express an
equilibrium maintained with reality. So long as the result of endeavour
is partly unforeseen and unintentional, so long as the will is partly
blind, the Life of Reason is still swaddled in ignominy and the animal
barks in the midst of human discourse. Wisdom and happiness consist in
having recast natural energies in the furnace of experience. Nor is this
experience merely a repressive force. It enshrines the successful
expressions of spirit as well as the shocks and vetoes of circumstance;
it enables a man to know himself in knowing the world and to discover
his ideal by the very ring, true or false, of fortune's coin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral science impeded by its chaotic data.</div>

<p>With this brief account we may leave the subject of rational ethics. Its
development is impossible save in the concrete, when a legislator,
starting from extant interests, considers what practices serve to render
those interests vital and genuine, and what external alliances might
lend them support and a more glorious expression. The <a name="Page_254" id="Page_254" />difficulty in
carrying rational policy very far comes partly from the refractory
materials at hand, and partly from the narrow range within which moral
science is usually confined. The materials are individual wills
naturally far from unanimous, lost for the most part in frivolous
pleasures, rivalries, and superstitions, and little inclined to listen
to a law-giver that, like a new Lycurgus, should speak to them of
unanimity, simplicity, discipline, and perfection. Devotion and
singlemindedness, perhaps possible in the cloister, are hard to
establish in the world; yet a rational morality requires that all lay
activities, all sweet temptations, should have their voice in the
conclave. Morality becomes rational precisely by refusing either to
accept human nature, as it sprouts, altogether without harmony, or to
mutilate it in the haste to make it harmonious. The condition,
therefore, of making a beginning in good politics is to find a set of
men with well-knit character and cogent traditions, so that there may be
a firm soil to cultivate and that labour may not be wasted in ploughing
the quicksands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and its unrecognised scope.</div>

<p>When such a starting-point is given, moral values radiate from it to the
very ends of the universe; and a failure to appreciate the range over
which rational estimation spreads is a second obstacle to sound ethics.
Because of this failure the earnest soul is too often intent on escaping
to heaven, while the gross politician is suffered to declaim about <a name="Page_255" id="Page_255" />the
national honour, and to promise this client an office, this district a
favour, and this class an iniquitous advantage. Politics is expected to
be sophistical; and in the soberest parliaments hardly an argument is
used or an ideal invoked which is not an insult to reason. Majorities
work by a system of bribes offered to the more barren interests of men
and to their more blatant prejudices. The higher direction of their
lives is relegated to religion, which, unhappily, is apt to suffer from
hereditary blindness to natural needs and to possible progress. The idea
that religion, as well as art, industry, nationality, and science,
should exist only for human life's sake and in order that men may live
better in this world, is an idea not even mooted in politics and perhaps
opposed by an official philosophy. The enterprise of individuals or of
small aristocratic bodies has meantime sown the world which we call
civilised with some seeds and nuclei of order. There are scattered about
a variety of churches, industries, academies, and governments. But the
universal order once dreamt of and nominally almost established, the
empire of universal peace, all-permeating rational art, and
philosophical worship, is mentioned no more. An unformulated conception,
the prerational ethics of private privilege and national unity, fills
the background of men's minds. It represents feudal traditions rather
than the tendency really involved in contemporary industry, science, or
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256" />philanthropy. Those dark ages, from which our political practice is
derived, had a political theory which we should do well to study; for
their theory about a universal empire and a catholic church was in turn
the echo of a former age of reason, when a few men conscious of ruling
the world had for a moment sought to survey it as a whole and to rule it
justly.</p>

<p>Modern rational ethics, however, or what approaches most nearly to such
a thing, has one advantage over the ancient and medi&aelig;val; it has
profited by Christian discipline and by the greater gentleness of modern
manners. It has recognised the rights of the dumb majority; it has
revolted against cruelty and preventable suffering and has bent itself
on diffusing well-being&mdash;the well-being that people want, and not the
so-called virtues which a supercilious aristocracy may find it
convenient to prescribe for them. It has based ethics on the foundation
on which actual morality rests; on nature, on the necessities of social
life, on the human instincts of sympathy and justice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fallacy in democratic hedonism.</div>

<p>It is all the more to be regretted that the only modern school of ethics
which is humane and honestly interested in progress should have given a
bad technical expression to its generous principles and should have
substituted a dubious psychology for Socratic dialectic. The mere fact
that somebody somewhere enjoys or dislikes a thing cannot give
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257" />direction to a rational will. That fact indicates a moral situation but
does not prescribe a definite action. A partial harmony or maladjustment
is thereby proved to exist, but the method is not revealed by which the
harmony should be sustained or the maladjustment removed. A given
harmony can be sustained by leaving things as they are or by changing
them together. A maladjustment can be removed by altering the
environment or by altering the man. Pleasures may be attached to
anything, and to pursue them in the abstract does not help to define any
particular line of conduct. The particular ideal pre-exists in the
observer; the mathematics of pleasure and pain cannot oblige him, for
instance, to prefer a hundred units of mindless pleasure enjoyed in
dreams to fifty units diffused over labour and discourse. He need not
limit his efforts to spreading needless comforts and silly pleasures
among the million; he need not accept for a goal a child's caprices
multiplied by infinity. Even these caprices, pleasures, and comforts
doubtless have their claims; but these claims have to be adjudicated by
the agent's autonomous conscience, and he will give them the place they
fill in his honest ideal of what it would be best to have in the world,
not the place which they might pretend to usurp there by a sort of
physical pressure. A conscience is a living function, expressing a
particular nature; it is not a passive medium where heterogeneous values
can find their <a name="Page_258" id="Page_258" />balance by virtue of their dead weight and number.</p>

<p>A moralist is called upon, first of all, to decide in what things
pleasure ought to be found. Of course his decision, if he is rational,
will not be arbitrary; it will conscientiously express his own
nature&mdash;on which alone honest ideals can rest&mdash;without attempting to
speak for the deafening and inconstant convocation of the whole sentient
universe. Duty is a matter of self-knowledge, not of statistics. A
living and particular will therein discovers its affinities, broadens
its basis, acknowledges its obligations, and co-operates with everything
that will co-operate with it; but it continues throughout to unfold a
particular life, finding its supports and extensions in the state, the
arts, and the universe. It cannot for a moment renounce its autonomy
without renouncing reason and perhaps decreeing the extinction both of
its own bodily basis and of its ideal method and policy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sympathy a conditional duty.</div>

<p>Utilitarianism needs to be transferred to Socratic and dialectical
ground, so that interest in absent interests may take its place in a
concrete ideal. It is a noble thing to be sensitive to others'
hardships, and happy in their happiness; but it is noble because it
refines the natural will without enfeebling it, offering it rather a new
and congenial development, one entirely predetermined by the fundamental
structure of human nature. Were man <a name="Page_259" id="Page_259" />not gregarious, were he not made to
be child, friend, husband, and father by turns, his morality would not
be social, but, like that of some silk-worm or some seraph, wholly
industrious or wholly contemplative. Parental and sexual instincts,
social life and the gift of co-operation carry sympathy implicitly with
them, as they carry the very faculty to recognise a fellow-being. To
make this sympathy explicit and to find one's happiness in exercising it
is to lay one's foundations deeper in nature and to expand the range of
one's being. Its limits, however, would be broken down and moral
dissolution would set in if, forgetting his humanity, a man should bid
all living creatures lapse with him into a delicious torpor, or run into
a cycle of pleasant dreams, so intense that death would be sure to
precede any awakening out of them. Great as may be the advance in
charity since the days of Socrates, therefore, the advance is within the
lines of his method; to trespass beyond them would be to recede.</p>

<p>This situation is repeated on a broader stage. A statesman entrusted
with power should regard nothing but his country's interests; to regard
anything else would be treason. He cannot allow foreign sentiment or
private hobbies to make him misapply the resources of his
fellow-countrymen to their own injury. But he may well have an
enlightened view of the interests which he serves; he might indeed be
expected to take a more pro<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260" />found and enlightened view of them than his
countrymen were commonly capable of, else he would have no right to his
eminent station. He should be the first to feel that to inflict injury
or foster hatred among other populations should not be a portion of a
people's happiness. A nation, like a man, is something ideal.
Indestructible mountains and valleys, crawled over by any sort of race,
do not constitute its identity. Its essence is a certain spirit, and
only what enters into this spirit can bind it morally, or preserve it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All life, and hence right life, finite and particular.</div>

<p>If a drop of water contains a million worlds which I, in swallowing, may
ruin or transform, that is Allah's business; mine is to clarify my own
intent, to cling to what ideals may lie within the circle of my
experience and practical imagination, so that I may have a natural
ground for my loyalties, and may be constant in them. It would not be a
rational ambition to wish to multiply the population of China by two, or
that of America by twenty, after ascertaining that life there contained
an overplus of pleasure. To weed a garden, however, would be rational,
though the weeds and their interests would have to be sacrificed in the
process. Utilitarianism took up false ground when it made right conduct
terminate in miscellaneous pleasures and pains, as if in their isolation
they constituted all that morality had to consider, and as if respect
offered to them, somehow in proportion to their quantity, were the true
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261" />conscience. The true conscience is rather an integrated natural will,
chastened by clear knowledge of what it pursues and may attain. What
morality has to consider is the form of life, not its quantity. In a
world that is perhaps infinite, moral life can spring only from definite
centres and is neither called upon nor able to estimate the whole, nor
to redress its balance. It is the free spirit of a part, finding its
affinities and equilibrium in the material whole which it reacts on, and
which it is in that measure enabled to understand.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>POST-RATIONAL MORALITY</p>


<div class="sidenote">Socratic ethics retrospective.</div>

<p>When Socrates and his two great disciples composed a system of rational
ethics they were hardly proposing practical legislation for mankind. One
by his irony, another by his frank idealism, and the third by his
preponderating interest in history and analysis, showed clearly enough
how little they dared to hope. They were merely writing an eloquent
epitaph on their country. They were publishing the principles of what
had been its life, gathering piously its broken ideals, and interpreting
its momentary achievement. The spirit of liberty and co-operation was
already dead. The private citizen, debauched by the largesses and petty
quarrels of his city, had become indolent and mean-spirited. He had
begun to question the utility of religion, of patriotism, and of
justice. Having allowed the organ for the ideal to atrophy in his soul,
he could dream of finding some sullen sort of happiness in unreason. He
felt that the austere glories of his country, as a Spartan regimen might
have preserved them, would not benefit that baser part of him which
<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263" />alone remained. Political virtue seemed a useless tax on his material
profit and freedom. The tedium and distrust proper to a disintegrated
society began to drive him to artificial excitements and superstitions.
Democracy had learned to regard as enemies the few in whom public
interest was still represented, the few whose nobler temper and
traditions still coincided with the general good. These last patriots
were gradually banished or exterminated, and with them died the spirit
that rational ethics had expressed. Philosophers were no longer suffered
to have illusions about the state. Human activity on the public stage
had shaken off all allegiance to art or reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rise of disillusioned moralities.</div>

<p>The biographer of reason might well be tempted to ignore the subsequent
attitudes into which moral life fell in the West, since they all
embodied a more or less complete despair, and, having abandoned the
effort to express the will honestly and dialectically, they could
support no moral science. The point was merely to console or deceive the
soul with some substitute for happiness. Life is older and more
persistent than reason, and the failure of a first experiment in
rationality does not deprive mankind of that mental and moral vegetation
which they possessed for ages in a wild state before the advent of
civilisation. They merely revert to their uncivil condition and espouse
whatever imaginative ideal comes to hand, <a name="Page_264" id="Page_264" />by which some semblance of
meaning and beauty may be given to existence without the labour of
building this meaning and beauty systematically out of its positive
elements.</p>

<p>Not to study these imaginative ideals, partial and arbitrary as they
are, would be to miss one of the most instructive points of view from
which the Life of Reason may be surveyed: the point of view of its
satirists. For moral ideals may follow upon philosophy, just as they may
precede it. When they follow, at least so long as they are consciously
embraced in view of reason's failure, they have a quite particular
value. Aversion to rational ideals does not then come, as the
intuitionist's aversion does, from moral incoherence or religious
prejudice. It does not come from lack of speculative power. On the
contrary, it may come from undue haste in speculation, from a too ready
apprehension of the visible march of things. The obvious irrationality
of nature as a whole, too painfully brought home to a musing mind, may
make it forget or abdicate its own rationality. In a decadent age, the
philosopher who surveys the world and sees that the end of it is even as
the beginning, may not feel that the intervening episode, in which he
and all he values after all figure, is worth consideration; and he may
cry, in his contemplative spleen, that <i>all</i> is vanity.</p>

<p>If you should still confront him with a theory of the ideal, he would
not be reduced, like the <a name="Page_265" id="Page_265" />pre-rational moralists in a similar case, to
mere inattention and bluster. If you told him that every art and every
activity involves a congruous good, and that the endeavour to realise
the ideal in every direction is an effort of which reason necessarily
approves, since reason is nothing but the method of that endeavour, he
would not need to deny your statements in order to justify himself. He
might admit the naturalness, the spontaneity, the ideal sufficiency of
your conceptions; but he might add, with the smile of the elder and the
sadder man, that he had experience of their futility. &quot;You Hellenisers,&quot;
he might say, &quot;are but children; you have not pondered the little
history you know. If thought were conversant with reality, if virtue
were stable and fruitful, if pains and policy were ultimately justified
by a greater good arising out of them&mdash;then, indeed, a life according to
reason might tempt a philosopher. But unfortunately not one of those
fond assumptions is true. Human thought is a meaningless phantasmagoria.
Virtue is a splendid and laborious folly, when it is not a pompous
garment that only looks respectable in the dark, being in truth full of
spots and ridiculous patches. Men's best laid plans become, in the
casual cross-currents of being, the occasion of their bitterest
calamities. How, then, live? How justify in our eyes, let us not say the
ways of God, but our own ways?&quot;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The illusion subsisting in them.</div>

<p>Such a position may be turned dialectically by <a name="Page_266" id="Page_266" />invoking whatever
positive hopes or convictions the critic may retain, who while he lives
cannot be wholly without them. But the position is specious and does not
collapse, like that of the intuitionist, at the first breath of
criticism. Pessimism, and all the moralities founded on despair, are not
pre-rational but post-rational. They are the work of men who more or
less explicitly have conceived the Life of Reason, tried it at least
imaginatively, and found it wanting. These systems are a refuge from an
intolerable situation: they are experiments in redemption. As a matter
of fact, animal instincts and natural standards of excellence are never
eluded in them, for no moral experience has other terms; but the part of
the natural ideal which remains active appears in opposition to all the
rest and, by an intelligible illusion, seems to be no part of that
natural ideal because, compared with the commoner passions on which it
reacts, it represents some simpler or more attenuated hope&mdash;the appeal
to some very humble or very much chastened satisfaction, or to an utter
change in the conditions of life.</p>

<p>Post-rational morality thus constitutes, in intention if not in fact, a
criticism of all experience. It thinks it is not, like pre-rational
morality, an arbitrary selection from among co-ordinate precepts. It is
an effort to subordinate all precepts to one, that points to some single
eventual <a name="Page_267" id="Page_267" />good. For it occurs to the founders of these systems that by
estranging oneself from the world, or resting in the moment's pleasure,
or mortifying the passions, or enduring all sufferings in patience, or
studying a perfect conformity with the course of affairs, one may gain
admission to some sort of residual mystical paradise; and this thought,
once conceived, is published as a revelation and accepted as a panacea.
It becomes in consequence (for such is the force of nature) the
foundation of elaborate institutions and elaborate philosophies, into
which the contents of the worldly life are gradually reintroduced.</p>

<p>When human life is in an acute crisis, the sick dreams that visit the
soul are the only evidence of her continued existence. Through them she
still envisages a good; and when the delirium passes and the normal
world gradually re-establishes itself in her regard, she attributes her
regeneration to the ministry of those phantoms, a regeneration due, in
truth, to the restored nutrition and circulation within her. In this way
post-rational systems, though founded originally on despair, in a later
age that has forgotten its disillusions may come to pose as the only
possible basis of morality. The philosophers addicted to each sect, and
brought up under its influence, may exhaust criticism and sophistry to
show that all faith and effort would be vain unless their particular
nostrum was accepted; and so a curious party philosophy arises in which,
after discred<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268" />iting nature and reason in general, the sectary puts
forward some mythical echo of reason and nature as the one saving and
necessary truth. The positive substance of such a doctrine is
accordingly pre-rational and perhaps crudely superstitious; but it is
introduced and nominally supported by a formidable indictment of
physical and moral science, so that the wretched idol ultimately offered
to our worship acquires a spurious halo and an imputed majesty by being
raised on a pedestal of infinite despair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Epicurean refuge in pleasure.</div>

<p>Socrates was still living when a school of post-rational morality arose
among the Sophists, which after passing quickly through various phases,
settled down into Epicureanism and has remained the source of a certain
consolation to mankind, which if somewhat cheap, is none the less
genuine. The pursuit of pleasure may seem simple selfishness, with a
tendency to debauchery; and in this case the pre-rational and
instinctive character of the maxim retained would be very obvious.
Pleasure, to be sure, is not the direct object of an unspoiled will; but
after some experience and discrimination, a man may actually guide
himself by a foretaste of the pleasures he has found in certain objects
and situations. The criticism required to distinguish what pays from
what does not pay may not often be carried very far; but it may
sometimes be carried to the length of suppressing every natural instinct
and natural hope, and of turning the <a name="Page_269" id="Page_269" />philosopher, as it turned Hegesias
the Cyrenaic, into a eulogist of death.</p>

<p>The post-rational principle in the system then comes to the fore, and we
see clearly that to sit down and reflect upon human life, picking out
its pleasant moments and condemning all the rest, is to initiate a
course of moral retrenchment. It is to judge what is worth doing, not by
the innate ambition of the soul, but by experience of incidental
feelings, which to a mind without creative ideas may seem the only
objects worthy of pursuit. That life ought to be accompanied by pleasure
and exempt from pain is certain; for this means that what is agreeable
to the whole process of nature would have become agreeable also to the
various partial impulses involved&mdash;another way of describing organic
harmony and physical perfection. But such a desirable harmony cannot be
defined or obtained by picking out and isolating from the rest those
occasions and functions in which it may already have been reached. These
partial harmonies may be actual arrests or impediments in the whole
which is to be made harmonious; and even when they are innocent or
helpful they cannot serve to determine the form which the general
harmony might take on. They merely illustrate its principle. The
organism in which this principle of harmony might find pervasive
expression is still potential, and the ideal is something of which, in
its concrete form, no man has had experience. It in<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270" />volves a propitious
material environment, perfect health, perfect arts, perfect government,
a mind enlarged to the knowledge and enjoyment of all its external
conditions and internal functions. Such an ideal is lost sight of when a
man cultivates his garden-plot of private pleasures, leaving it to
chance and barbarian fury to govern the state and quicken the world's
passions.</p>

<p>Even Aristippus, the first and most delightful of hedonists, who really
enjoyed the pleasures he advocated and was not afraid of the incidental
pains&mdash;even Aristippus betrayed the post-rational character of his
philosophy by abandoning politics, mocking science, making his peace
with all abuses that fostered his comfort, and venting his wit on all
ambitions that exceeded his hopes. A great temperament can carry off a
rough philosophy. Rebellion and license may distinguish honourable souls
in an age of polite corruption, and a grain of sincerity is better, in
moral philosophy, than a whole harvest of conventionalities. The
violence and shamelessness of Aristippus were corrected by Epicurus; and
a balance was found between utter despair and utter irresponsibility.
Epicureanism retrenched much: it cut off politics, religion, enterprise,
and passion. These things it convicted of vanity, without stopping to
distinguish in them what might be inordinate from what might be
rational. At the same time it retained friendship, freedom of soul, and
intellectual light. It cultivated unworldliness with<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271" />out superstition
and happiness without illusion. It was tender toward simple and honest
things, scornful and bitter only against pretence and usurpation. It
thus marked a first halting-place in the retreat of reason, a stage
where the soul had thrown off only the higher and more entangling part
of her burden and was willing to live, in somewhat reduced
circumstances, on the remainder. Such a philosophy expresses well the
genuine sentiment of persons, at once mild and emancipated, who find
themselves floating on the ebb-tide of some civilisation, and enjoying
its fruits, without any longer representing the forces that brought that
civilisation about.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stoic recourse to conformity.</div>

<p>The same emancipation, without its mildness, appeared in the Cynics,
whose secret it was to throw off all allegiance and all dependence on
circumstance, and to live entirely on inner strength of mind, on pride
and inflexible humour. The renunciation was far more sweeping than that
of Epicurus, and indeed wellnigh complete; yet the Stoics, in
underpinning the Cynical self-sufficiency with a system of physics,
introduced into the life of the sect a contemplative element which very
much enlarged and ennobled its sympathies. Nature became a sacred
system, the laws of nature being eulogistically called rational laws,
and the necessity of things, because it might be foretold in auguries,
being called providence. There was some intellectual confusion in all
this; but con<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272" />templation, even if somewhat idolatrous, has a purifying
effect, and the sad and solemn review of the cosmos to which the Stoic
daily invited his soul, to make it ready to face its destiny, doubtless
liberated it from many an unworthy passion. The impressive spectacle of
things was used to remind the soul of her special and appropriate
function, which was to be rational. This rationality consisted partly in
insight, to perceive the necessary order of things, and partly in
conformity, to perceive that this order, whatever it might be, could
serve the soul to exercise itself upon, and to face with equanimity.</p>

<p>Despair, in this system, flooded a much larger area of human life;
everything, in fact, was surrendered except the will to endure whatever
might come. The concentration was much more marked, since only a formal
power of perception and defiance was retained and made the sphere of
moral life; this rational power, at least in theory, was the one peak
that remained visible above the deluge. But in practice much more was
retained. Some distinction was drawn, however unwarrantably, between
external calamities and human turpitude, so that absolute conformity and
acceptance might not be demanded by the latter; although the chief
occasion which a Stoic could find to practise fortitude and recognise
the omnipresence of law was in noting the universal corruption of the
state and divining its ruin. The obligation to conform to nature
<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273" />(which, strictly speaking, could not be disregarded in any case) was
interpreted to signify that every one should perform the offices
conventionally attached to his station. In this way a perfunctory
citizenship and humanity were restored to the philosopher. But the
restored life was merely histrionic: the Stoic was a recluse parading
the market-place and a monk disguised in armour. His interest and faith
were centred altogether on his private spiritual condition. He
cultivated the society of those persons who, he thought, might teach him
some virtue. He attended to the affairs of state so as to exercise his
patience. He might even lead an army to battle, if he wished to test his
endurance and make sure that philosophy had rendered him indifferent to
the issue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conformity the core of Islam.</div>

<p>The strain and artifice of such a discipline, with merely formal goals
and no hope on earth or in heaven, could not long maintain itself; and
doubtless it existed, at a particular juncture, only in a few souls.
Resignation to the will of God, says Bishop Butler, is <i>the whole of
piety</i>; yet mere resignation would make a sorry religion and the
negation of all morality, unless the will of God was understood to be
quite different from his operation in nature. To turn Stoicism into a
workable religion we need to qualify it with some pre-rational maxims.
Islam, for instance, which boasts that in its essence it is nothing but
the primitive and natural religion of mankind, consists in <a name="Page_274" id="Page_274" />abandoning
oneself to the will of God or, in other words, in accepting the
inevitable. This will of God is learned for the most part by observing
the course of nature and history, and remembering the fate meted out
habitually to various sorts of men. Were this all, Islam would be a pure
Stoicism, and Hebraic religion, in its ultimate phase, would be simply
the eloquence of physics. It would not, in that case, be a moral
inspiration at all, except as contemplation and the sense of one's
nothingness might occasionally silence the passions and for a moment
bewilder the mind. On recovering from this impression, however, men
would find themselves enriched with no self-knowledge, armed with no
precepts, and stimulated by no ideal. They would be reduced to enacting
their incidental impulses, as the animals are, quite as if they had
never perceived that in doing so they were fulfilling a divine decree.
Enlightened Moslems, accordingly, have often been more Epicurean than
Stoical; and if they have felt themselves (not without some reason)
superior to Christians in delicacy, in <i>savoir vivre</i>, in kinship with
all natural powers, this sense of superiority has been quite
rationalistic and purely human. Their religion contributed to it only
because it was simpler, freer from superstition, nearer to a clean and
pleasant regimen in life. Resignation to the will of God being granted,
expression of the will of man might more freely begin.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275" />enveloped in arbitrary doctrines.</div>

<p>What made Islam, however, a positive and contagious novelty was the
assumption that God's will might be incidentally revealed to prophets
before the event, so that past experience was not the only source from
which its total operation might be gathered. In its opposition to
grosser idolatries Islam might appeal to experience and challenge those
who trusted in special deities to justify their worship in face of the
facts. The most decisive facts against idolaters, however, were not yet
patent, but were destined to burst upon mankind at the last day&mdash;and
most unpleasantly for the majority. Where Mohammed speaks in the name of
the universal natural power he is abundantly scornful toward that fond
paganism which consists in imagining distinct patrons for various
regions of nature or for sundry human activities. In turning to such
patrons the pagan regards something purely ideal or, as the Koran
shrewdly observes, worships his own passions. Allah, on the contrary, is
overwhelmingly external and as far as possible from being ideal. He is
indeed the giver of all good things, as of all evil, and while his
mercies are celebrated on every page of the Koran, these mercies consist
in the indulgence he is expected to show to his favourites, and the
exceeding reward reserved for them after their earthly trials. Allah's
mercy does not exclude all those senseless and unredeemed cruelties of
which nature is daily guilty; nay, it shines all the <a name="Page_276" id="Page_276" />more conspicuously
by contrast with his essential irresponsibility and wanton wrath, a part
of his express purpose being to keep hell full of men and demons.</p>

<p>The tendency toward enlightenment which Islam represents, and the limits
of that enlightenment, may be illustrated by the precept about unclean
animals. Allah, we are told, being merciful and gracious, made the world
for man's use, with all the animals in it. We may therefore justly
slaughter and devour them, in so far as comports with health; but, of
course, we may not eat animals that have died a natural death, nor those
offered in sacrifice to false gods, nor swine; for to do so would be an
abomination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The latter alone lend it practical force.</div>

<p>Unfortunately religious reformers triumph not so much by their rational
insight as by their halting, traditional maxims. Mohammed felt the unity
of God like a philosopher; but people listened to him because he
preached it like a sectary. God, as he often reminds us, did not make
the world for a plaything; he made it in order to establish distinctions
and separate by an immense interval the fate of those who conform to the
truth from the fate of those who ignore it. Human life is indeed beset
with enough imminent evils to justify this urgent tone in the Semitic
moralist and to lend his precepts a stern practical ring, absent from
merely Platonic idealisms. But this stringency, which is called
positivism when <a name="Page_277" id="Page_277" />the conditions of welfare are understood, becomes
fanaticism when they are misrepresented. Had Mohammed spoken only of the
dynamic unity in things, the omnipresence of destiny, and the actual
conditions of success and failure in the world, he would not have been
called a prophet or have had more than a dozen intelligent followers,
scattered over as many centuries; but the weakness of his intellect, and
his ignorance of nature, made the success of his mission. It is easier
to kindle righteous indignation against abuses when, by abating them, we
further our personal interests; and Mohammed might have been less
zealous in denouncing false gods had his own God been altogether the
true one. But, in the heat of his militancy, he descends so far as to
speak of <i>God's interests</i> which the faithful embrace, and of fighting
in <i>God's cause</i>. By these notions, so crudely pre-rational, we are
allowed to interpret and discount the pantheistic sublimities with which
in most places we are regaled; and in order that a morality, too weak to
be human, may not wither altogether in the fierce light of the Absolute,
we are led to humanise the Absolute into a finite force, needing our
support against independent enemies. So complete is the bankruptcy of
that Stoic morality which thinks to live on the worship of That which
Is.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral ambiguity in pantheism.</div>

<p>As extremes are said to meet, so we may say that a radical position is
often the point of de<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278" />parture for opposite systems. Pantheism, or
religion and morality abdicating in favour of physics, may, in practice,
be interpreted in contrary ways. To be in sympathy with the Whole may
seem to require us to outgrow and discard every part; yet, on the other
hand, there is no obvious reason why Being should love its essence in a
fashion that involves hating every possible form of Being. The
worshipper of Being accordingly assumes now one, now the other, of two
opposite attitudes, according as the society in which he lives is in a
prerational or a post-rational state of culture. Pantheism is
interpreted pre-rationally, as by the early Mohammedans, or by the
Hegelians, when people are not yet acquainted, or not yet disgusted,
with worldliness; the Absolute then seems to lend a mystical sanction to
whatever existences or tendencies happen to be afoot. Morality is
reduced to sanctioning reigning conventions, or reigning passions, on
the authority of the universe. Thus the Moslems, by way of serving
Allah, could extend their conquests and cultivate the arts and pleasures
congenial to a self-sufficing soul, at once indolent and fierce; while
the transcendentalists of our times, by way of accepting their part in
the divine business, have merely added a certain speculative loftiness
to the maxims of some sect or the chauvinism of some nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Under stress, it becomes ascetic and requires a mythology.</div>

<p>To accept everything, however, is not an easy <a name="Page_279" id="Page_279" />nor a tolerable thing,
unless you are naturally well pleased with what falls to your share.
However the Absolute may feel, a moral creature has to hate some forms
of being; and if the age has thrust these forms before a man's eyes, and
imposed them upon him, not being suffered by his pantheism to blame the
Absolute he will (by an inconsistency) take to blaming himself. It will
be his finitude, his inordinate claims, his enormous effrontery in
having any will or any preference in particular, that will seem to him
the source of all evil and the single blot on the infinite lucidity of
things. Pantheism, under these circumstances, will issue in a
post-rational morality. It will practise asceticism and look for a
mystical deliverance from finite existence.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances myth is inevitably reintroduced. Without it,
no consolation could be found except in the prospect of death and,
awaiting that, in incidental natural satisfactions; whereby absorption
in the Absolute might come to look not only impossible but distinctly
undesirable. To make retreat out of human nature seem a possible
vocation, this nature itself must, in some myth, be represented as
unnatural; the soul that this life stifles must be said to come from
elsewhere and to be fitted to breathe some element far rarer and finer
than this sublunary fog.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A supernatural world made by the Platonist out of dialectic.</div>

<p>A curious foothold for such a myth was fur<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280" />nished by the Socratic
philosophy. Plato, wafted by his poetic vision too far, perhaps, from
the utilitarianism of his master, had eulogised concretions in discourse
at the expense of existences and had even played with cosmological
myths, meant to express the values of things, by speaking as if these
values had brought things into being. The dialectical terms thus
contrasted with natural objects, and pictured as natural powers,
furnished the dogmas needed at this juncture by a post-rational
religion. The spell which dialectic can exercise over an abstracted mind
is itself great; and it may grow into a sacred influence and a positive
revelation when it offers a sanctuary from a weary life in the world.
Out of the play of notions carried on in a prayerful dream wonderful
mysteries can be constructed, to be presently announced to the people
and made the core of sacramental injunctions. When the tide of vulgar
superstition is at the flood and every form of quackery is welcome, we
need not wonder that a theosophy having so respectable a
core&mdash;something, indeed, like a true logic misunderstood&mdash;should gain
many adherents. Out of the names of things and of virtues a mystic
ladder could be constructed by which to leave the things and the virtues
themselves behind; but the sagacity and exigencies of the school would
not fail to arrange the steps in this progress&mdash;the end of which was
unattainable except, perhaps, in a momentary <a name="Page_281" id="Page_281" />ecstasy&mdash;so that the
obvious duties of men would continue, for the nonce, to be imposed upon
them. The chief difference made in morals would be only this: that the
positive occasions and sanctions of good conduct would no longer be
mentioned with respect, but the imagination would be invited to dwell
instead on mystical issues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Herbraic cry for redemption.</div>

<p>Neo-Platonic morality, through a thousand learned and vulgar channels,
permeated Christianity and entirely transformed it. Original
Christianity was, though in another sense, a religion of redemption. The
Jews, without dreaming of original sin or of any inherent curse in being
finite, had found themselves often in the sorest material straits. They
hoped, like all primitive peoples, that relief might come by
propitiating the deity. They knew that the sins of the fathers were
visited upon the children even to the third and fourth generation. They
had accepted this idea of joint responsibility and vicarious atonement,
turning in their unphilosophical way this law of nature into a principle
of justice. Meantime the failure of all their cherished ambitions had
plunged them into a penitential mood. Though in fact pious and virtuous
to a fault, they still looked for repentance&mdash;their own or the
world's&mdash;to save them. This redemption was to be accomplished in the
Hebrew spirit, through long-suffering and devotion to the Law, with the
Hebrew solidarity, by vicarious attribution of <a name="Page_282" id="Page_282" />merits and demerits
within the household of the faith.</p>

<p>Such a way of conceiving redemption was far more dramatic, poignant, and
individual than the Neo-Platonic; hence it was far more popular and
better fitted to be a nucleus for religious devotion. However much,
therefore, Christianity may have insisted on renouncing the world, the
flesh, and the devil, it always kept in the background this perfectly
Jewish and pre-rational craving for a delectable promised land. The
journey might be long and through a desert, but milk and honey were to
flow in the oasis beyond. Had renunciation been fundamental or revulsion
from nature complete, there would have been no much-trumpeted last
judgment and no material kingdom of heaven. The renunciation was only
temporary and partial; the revulsion was only against incidental evils.
Despair touched nothing but the present order of the world, though at
first it took the extreme form of calling for its immediate destruction.
This was the sort of despair and renunciation that lay at the bottom of
Christian repentance; while hope in a new order of this world, or of one
very like it, lay at the bottom of Christian joy. A temporary sacrifice,
it was thought, and a partial mutilation would bring the spirit
miraculously into a fresh paradise. The pleasures nature had grudged or
punished, grace was to offer as a reward for faith and patience. The
earthly life which was vain <a name="Page_283" id="Page_283" />as an experience was to be profitable as a
trial. Normal experience, appropriate exercise for the spirit, would
thereafter begin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The two factors meet in Christianity.</div>

<p>Christianity is thus a system of postponed rationalism, a rationalism
intercepted by a supernatural version of the conditions of happiness.
Its moral principle is reason&mdash;the only moral principle there is; its
motive power is the impulse and natural hope to be and to be happy.
Christianity merely renews and reinstates these universal principles
after a first disappointment and a first assault of despair, by opening
up new vistas of accomplishment, new qualities and measures of success.
The Christian field of action being a world of grace enveloping the
world of nature, many transitory reversals of acknowledged values may
take place in its code. Poverty, chastity, humility, obedience,
self-sacrifice, ignorance, sickness, and dirt may all acquire a
religious worth which reason, in its direct application, might scarcely
have found in them; yet these reversed appreciations are merely
incidental to a secret rationality, and are justified on the ground that
human nature, as now found, is corrupt and needs to be purged and
transformed before it can safely manifest its congenital instincts and
become again an authoritative criterion of values. In the kingdom of God
men would no longer need to do penance, for life there would be truly
natural and there the soul would be at last in her native sphere.</p>

<p><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284" />This submerged optimism exists in Christianity, being a heritage from
the Jews; and those Protestant communities that have rejected the pagan
and Platonic elements that overlaid it have little difficulty in
restoring it to prominence. Not, however, without abandoning the soul of
the gospel; for the soul of the gospel, though expressed in the language
of Messianic hopes, is really post-rational. It was not to marry and be
given in marriage, or to sit on thrones, or to unravel metaphysical
mysteries, or to enjoy any of the natural delights renounced in this
life, that Christ summoned his disciples to abandon all they had and to
follow him. There was surely a deeper peace in his self-surrender. It
was not a new thing even among the Jews to use the worldly promises of
their exoteric religion as symbols for inner spiritual revolutions; and
the change of heart involved in genuine Christianity was not a fresh
excitation of gaudy hopes, nor a new sort of utilitarian, temporary
austerity. It was an emptying of the will, in respect to all human
desires, so that a perfect charity and contemplative justice, falling
like the Father's gifts ungrudgingly on the whole creation, might take
the place of ambition, petty morality, and earthly desires. It was a
renunciation which, at least in Christ himself and in his more spiritual
disciples, did not spring from disappointed illusion or lead to other
unregenerate illusions even more sure to be dispelled by events. It
sprang rather from <a name="Page_285" id="Page_285" />a native speculative depth, a natural affinity to
the divine fecundity, serenity, and sadness of the world. It was the
spirit of prayer, the kindliness and insight which a pure soul can fetch
from contemplation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consequent electicism.</div>

<p>This mystical detachment, supervening on the dogged old Jewish optimism,
gave Christianity a double aspect, and had some curious consequence in
later times. Those who were inwardly convinced&mdash;as most religious minds
were under the Roman Empire&mdash;that all earthly things were vanity, and
that they plunged the soul into an abyss of nothingness if not of
torment, could, in view of brighter possibilities in another world,
carry their asceticism and their cult of suffering farther than a purely
negative system, like the Buddhistic, would have allowed. For a
discipline that is looked upon as merely temporary can contradict nature
more boldly than one intended to take nature's place. The hope of
unimaginable benefits to ensue could drive religion to greater frenzies
than it could have fallen into if its object had been merely to silence
the will. Christianity persecuted, tortured, and burned. Like a hound it
tracked the very scent of heresy. It kindled wars, and nursed furious
hatreds and ambitions. It sanctified, quite like Mohammedanism,
extermination and tyranny. All this would have been impossible if, like
Buddhism, it had looked only to peace and the liberation of souls. It
looked beyond; it <a name="Page_286" id="Page_286" />dreamt of infinite blisses and crowns it should be
crowned with before an electrified universe and an applauding God. These
were rival baits to those which the world fishes with, and were snapped
at, when seen, with no less avidity. Man, far from being freed from his
natural passions, was plunged into artificial ones quite as violent and
much more disappointing. Buddhism had tried to quiet a sick world with
an&aelig;sthetics; Christianity sought to purge it with fire.</p>

<p>Another consequence of combining, in the Christian life, post-rational
with pre-rational motives, a sense of exile and renunciation with hopes
of a promised land, was that esoteric piety could choose between the two
factors, even while it gave a verbal assent to the dogmas that included
both. Mystics honoured the post-rational motive and despised the
pre-rational; positivists clung to the second and hated the first. To
the spiritually minded, whose religion was founded on actual insight and
disillusion, the joys of heaven could never be more than a symbol for
the intrinsic worth of sanctity. To the worldling those heavenly joys
were nothing but a continuation of the pleasures and excitements of this
life, serving to choke any reflections which, in spite of himself, might
occasionally visit him about the vanity of human wishes. So that
Christianity, even in its orthodox forms, covers various kinds of
morality, and its philosophical incoherence betrays itself in disruptive
movements, profound schisms, <a name="Page_287" id="Page_287" />and total alienation on the part of one
Christian from the inward faith of another. Trappist or Calvinist may be
practising a heroic and metaphysical self-surrender while the
busy-bodies of their respective creeds are fostering, in God's name, all
their hot and miscellaneous passions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The negation of naturalism never complete.</div>

<p>This contradiction, present in the overt morality of Christendom, cannot
be avoided, however, by taking refuge again in pure asceticism. Every
post-rational system is necessarily self-contradictory. Its despair
cannot be universal nor its nihilism complete so long as it remains a
coherent method of action, with particular goals and a steady faith that
their attainment is possible. The renunciation of the will must stop at
the point where the will to be saved makes its appearance: and as this
desire may be no less troublesome and insistent than any other, as it
may even become a tormenting obsession, the mystic is far from the end
of his illusions when he sets about to dispel them. There is one
rational method to which, in post-rational systems, the world is still
thought to be docile, one rational endeavour which nature is sure to
crown with success. This is the method of deliverance from existence,
the effort after salvation. There is, let us say, a law of Karma, by
which merit and demerit accruing in one incarnation pass on to the next
and enable the soul to rise continuously through a series of stages.
Thus the world, though called illusory, is not <a name="Page_288" id="Page_288" />wholly intractable. It
provides systematically for an exit out of its illusions. On this
rational ordinance of phenomena, which is left standing by an imperfect
nihilism, Buddhist morality is built. Rational endeavour remains
possible because experience is calculable and fruitful in this one
respect, that it dissolves in the presence of goodness and knowledge.</p>

<p>Similarly in Christian ethics, the way of the cross has definite
stations and a definite end. However negative this end may be thought to
be, the assurance that it may be attained is a remnant of natural hope
in the bosom of pessimism. A complete disillusion would have involved
the neglect of such an assurance, the denial that it was possible or at
least that it was to be realised under specific conditions. That
conversion and good works lead to something worth attaining is a new
sort of positivistic hope. A complete scepticism would involve a doubt,
not only concerning the existence of such a method of salvation, but
also (what is more significant) concerning the importance of applying it
if it were found. For to assert that salvation is not only possible but
urgently necessary, that every soul is now in an intolerable condition
and should search for an ultimate solution to all its troubles, a
restoration to a normal and somehow blessed state&mdash;what is this but to
assert that the nature of things has a permanent constitution, by
conformity with which man may secure his happiness? More<a name="Page_289" id="Page_289" />over, we assert
in such a faith that this natural constitution of things is discoverable
in a sufficient measure to guide our action to a successful issue.
Belief in Karma, in prayer, in sacraments, in salvation is a remnant of
a natural belief in the possibility of living successfully. The remnant
may be small and &quot;expressed in fancy.&quot; Transmigration or an atonement
may be chimerical ideas. Yet the mere fact of reliance upon something,
the assumption that the world is steady and capable of rational
exploitation, even if in a supernatural interest and by semi-magical
means, amounts to an essential loyalty to postulates of practical
reason, an essential adherence to natural morality.</p>

<p>The pretension to have reached a point of view from which <i>all</i> impulse
may be criticised is accordingly an untenable pretension. It is
abandoned in the very systems in which it was to be most thoroughly
applied. The instrument of criticism must itself be one impulse
surviving the wreck of all the others; the vision of salvation and of
the way thither must be one dream among the rest. A single suggestion of
experience is thus accepted while all others are denied; and although a
certain purification and revision of morality may hence ensue, there is
no real penetration to a deeper principle than spontaneous reason, no
revelation of a higher end than the best possible happiness. One
sporadic growth of human nature may be substituted for its whole
<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290" />luxuriant vegetation; one negative or formal element of happiness may
be preferred to the full entelechy of life. We may see the Life of
Reason reduced to straits, made to express itself in a niggardly and
fantastic environment; but we have, in principle and essence, the Life
of Reason still, empirical in its basis and rational in its method, its
substance impulse and its end happiness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spontaneous values rehabilitated.</div>

<p>So much for the umbilical cord that unites every living post-rational
system to the matrix of human hopes. There remains a second point of
contact between these systems and rational morality: the reinstated
natural duties which all religions and philosophies, in order to subsist
among civilised peoples, are at once obliged to sanction and somehow to
deduce from their peculiar principles. The most plausible evidence which
a supernatural doctrine can give of its truth is the beauty and
rationality of its moral corollaries. It is instructive to observe that
a gospel's congruity with natural reason and common humanity is regarded
as the decisive mark of its supernatural origin. Indeed, were
inspiration not the faithful echo of plain conscience and vulgar
experience there would be no means of distinguishing it from madness.
Whatever poetic idea a prophet starts with, in whatever intuition or
analogy he finds a hint of salvation, it is altogether necessary that he
should hasten to interpret his oracle in such a manner that it may
sanction without disturb<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291" />ing the system of indispensable natural duties,
although these natural duties, by being attached artificially to
supernatural dogmas, may take on a different tone, justify themselves by
a different rhetoric, and possibly suffer real transformation in some
minor particulars. Systems of post-rational morality are not original
works: they are versions of natural morality translated into different
metaphysical languages, each of which adds its peculiar flavour, its own
genius and poetry, to the plain sense of the common original.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A witness out of India.</div>

<p>In the doctrine of Karma, for instance, experience of retribution is
ideally extended and made precise. Acts, daily experience teaches us,
form habits; habits constitute character, and each man's character, as
Heraclitus said, is his guardian deity, the artisan of his fate. We need
but raise this particular observation to a solitary eminence, after the
manner of post-rational thinking; we need but imagine it to underlie and
explain all other empirical observations, so that character may come to
figure as an absolute cause, of which experience itself is an attendant
result. Such arbitrary emphasis laid on some term of experience is the
source of each metaphysical system in turn. In this case the surviving
dogma will have yielded an explanation of our environment no less than
of our state of heart by instituting a deeper spiritual law, a certain
balance of merit and demerit in the soul, accruing to it through a
series <a name="Page_292" id="Page_292" />of previous incarnations. This fabulous starting-point was
gained by an imaginary extension of the law of moral continuity and
natural retribution; but when, accepting this starting-point, the
believer went on to inquire what he should do to be saved and to cancel
the heavy debts he inherited from his mythical past, he would merely
enumerate the natural duties of man, giving them, however, a new
sanction and conceiving them as if they emanated from his new-born
metaphysical theory. This theory, apart from a natural conscience and
traditional code, would have been perfectly barren. The notion that
every sin must be expiated does not carry with it any information about
what acts are sins.</p>

<p>This indispensable information must still be furnished by common
opinion. Those acts which bring suffering after them, those acts which
arouse the enmity of our fellows and, by a premonition of that enmity,
arouse our own shame&mdash;those are assumed and deputed to be sinful; and
the current code of morality being thus borrowed without begging leave,
the law of absolute retribution can be brought in to paint the picture
of moral responsibility in more glaring colours and to extend the vista
of rewards and punishments into a rhetorical infinite. Buddhistic
morality was natural morality intensified by this forced sense of minute
and boundless responsibility. It was coloured also by the negative,
pessimistic justification which this dogma gives to <a name="Page_293" id="Page_293" />moral endeavour.
Every virtue was to be viewed as merely removing guilt and alleviating
suffering, knowledge itself being precious only as a means to that end.
The ultimate inspiration of right living was to be hope of perfect
peace&mdash;a hope generously bestowed by nature on every spirit which, being
linked to the flux of things, is conscious of change and susceptible of
weariness, but a hope which the irresponsible Oriental imagination had
disturbed with bad dreams. A pathetic feminine quality was thereby
imparted to moral feeling; we were to be good for pity's sake, for the
sake of a great distant deliverance from profound sorrows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dignity of post-rational morality.</div>

<p>The pathetic idiosyncrasy of this religion has probably enabled it to
touch many a heart and to lift into speculation many a life otherwise
doomed to be quite instinctive animal. It has kept morality pure&mdash;free
from that admixture of worldly and partisan precepts with which less
pessimistic systems are encumbered. Restraint can be rationally imposed
on a given will only by virtue of evils which would be involved in its
satisfaction, by virtue, in other words, of some actual demand whose
disappointment would ensue upon inconsiderate action. To save, to cure,
to nourish are duties far less conditional than would be a supposed duty
to acquire or to create. There is no harm in merely not being, and
privation is an evil only when, after we exist, it deprives us of
<a name="Page_294" id="Page_294" />something naturally requisite, the absence of which would defeat
interests already launched into the world. If there is something in a
purely remedial system of morality which seems one-sided and extreme, we
must call to mind the far less excusable one-sidedness of those
moralities of prejudice to which we are accustomed in the Occident&mdash;the
ethics of irrational acquisitiveness, irrational faith, and irrational
honour. Buddhistic morality, so reasonable and beautifully persuasive,
rising so willingly to the ideal of sanctity, merits in comparison the
profoundest respect. It is lifted as far above the crudities of
intuitionism as the whisperings of an angel are above a schoolboy's
code.</p>

<p>A certain bias and deviation from strict reason seems, indeed,
inseparable from any moral reform, from any doctrine that is to be
practically and immediately influential. Socratic ethics was too perfect
an expression to be much of a force. Philosophers whose hearts are set
on justice and pure truth often hear reproaches addressed to them by the
fanatic, who contrasts the conspicuous change in this or that direction
accomplished by his preaching with the apparent impotence of reason and
thought. Reason's resources are in fact so limited that it is usually
reduced to guerilla warfare: a general plan of campaign is useless when
only insignificant forces obey our commands. Moral progress is for that
reason often greatest when some nobler passion or more fortunate
<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295" />prejudice takes the lead and subdues its meaner companions without
needing to rely on the consciousness of ultimate benefits hence accruing
to the whole life. So a pessimistic and merely remedial morality may
accomplish reforms which reason, with its broader and milder suasion,
might have failed in. If certain rare and precious virtues can thus be
inaugurated, under the influence of a zeal exaggerating its own
justification, there will be time later to insist on the complementary
truths and to tack in the other direction after having been carried
forward a certain distance by this oblique advance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Absurdities nevertheless involved.</div>

<p>At the same time neglect of reason is never without its dangers and its
waste. The Buddhistic system itself suffers from a fundamental
contradiction, because its framers did not acknowledge the actual limits
of retribution nor the empirical machinery by which benefits and
injuries are really propagated. It is an onerous condition which
religions must fulfil, if they would prevail in the world, that they
must have their roots in the past. Buddhism had its mission of
salvation; but to express this mission to its proselytes it was obliged
to borrow the language of the fantastic metaphysics which had preceded
it in India. The machinery of transmigration had to serve as a
scaffolding to raise the monument of mercy, purity, and spirituality.
But this fabulous background given to life was really inconsistent with
<a name="Page_296" id="Page_296" />what was best in the new morality; just as in Christianity the
post-rational evangelical ideals of redemption and regeneration, of the
human will mystically reversed, were radically incompatible with the
pre-rational myths about a creation and a political providence. The
doctrine of Karma was a hypostasis of moral responsibility; but in
making responsibility dynamic and all-explaining, the theory
discountenanced in advance the charitable efforts of Buddhism&mdash;the
desire to instruct and save every fellow-creature. For if all my
fortunes depend upon my former conduct, I am the sole artificer of my
destiny. The love, the pity, the science, or the prayers of others can
have no real influence over my salvation. They cannot diminish by one
tittle my necessary sufferings, nor accelerate by one instant the period
which my own action appoints for my deliverance. Perhaps another's
influence might, in the false world of time and space, change the order
or accidental vesture of my moral experiences; but their quantity and
value, being the exact counterpart of my free merits and demerits, could
not be affected at all by those extraneous doings.</p>

<p>Therefore the empirical fact that we can help one another remains in
Buddhism (as in any retributive scheme) only by a serious inconsistency;
and since this fact is the sanction of whatever moral efficacy can be
attributed to Buddhism, in sobering, teaching, and saving mankind,
anything inconsistent with it is fundamentally <a name="Page_297" id="Page_297" />repugnant to the whole
system. Yet on that repugnant and destructive dogma of Karma Buddhism
was condemned to base its instruction. This is the heavy price paid for
mythical consolations, that they invalidate the moral values they are
intended to emphasise. Nature has allowed the innocent to suffer for the
guilty, and the guilty, perhaps, to die in some measure unpunished. To
correct this imperfection we feign a closed circle of personal
retributions, exactly proportionate to personal deserts. But thereby,
without perceiving it, we have invalidated all political and social
responsibility, and denied that any man can be benefited or injured by
any other. Our moral ambition has overleaped itself and carried us into
a non-natural world where morality is impotent and unmeaning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The soul of positivism in all ideals.</div>

<p>Post-rational systems accordingly mark no real advance and offer no
genuine solution to spiritual enigmas. The saving force each of them
invokes is merely some remnant of that natural energy which animates the
human animal. Faith in the supernatural is a desperate wager made by man
at the lowest ebb of his fortunes; it is as far as possible from being
the source of that normal vitality which subsequently, if his fortunes
mend, he may gradually recover. Under the same religion, with the same
posthumous alternatives and mystic harmonies hanging about them,
different races, or the same race at different periods, will manifest
the most <a name="Page_298" id="Page_298" />opposite moral characteristics. Belief in a thousand hells and
heavens will not lift the apathetic out of apathy or hold back the
passionate from passion; while a newly planted and ungalled community,
in blessed forgetfulness of rewards or punishments, of cosmic needs or
celestial sanctions, will know how to live cheerily and virtuously for
life's own sake, putting to shame those thin vaticinations. To hope for
a second life, to be had gratis, merely because this life has lost its
savour, or to dream of a different world, because nature seems too
intricate and unfriendly, is in the end merely to play with words; since
the supernatural has no permanent aspect or charm except in so far as it
expresses man's natural situation and points to the satisfaction of his
earthly interests. What keeps supernatural morality, in its better
forms, within the limits of sanity is the fact that it reinstates in
practice, under novel associations and for motives ostensibly different,
the very natural virtues and hopes which, when seen to be merely
natural, it had thrown over with contempt. The new dispensation itself,
if treated in the same spirit, would be no less contemptible; and what
makes it genuinely esteemed is the restored authority of those human
ideals which it expresses in a fable.</p>

<p>The extent of this moral restoration, the measure in which nature is
suffered to bloom in the sanctuary, determines the value of
post-rational moralities. They may preside over a good life, <a name="Page_299" id="Page_299" />personal
or communal, when their symbolism, though cumbrous, is not deceptive;
when the supernatural machinery brings man back to nature through
mystical circumlocutions, and becomes itself a poetic echo of experience
and a dramatic impersonation of reason. The peculiar accent and emphasis
which it will not cease to impose on the obvious lessons of life need
not then repel the wisest intelligence. True sages and true
civilisations can accordingly flourish under a dispensation nominally
supernatural; for that supernaturalism may have become a mere form in
which imagination clothes a rational and humane wisdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moribund dreams and perennial realities.</div>

<p>People who speak only one language have some difficulty in conceiving
that things should be expressed just as well in some other; a prejudice
which does not necessarily involve their mistaking words for things or
being practically misled by their inflexible vocabulary. So it
constantly happens that supernatural systems, when they have long
prevailed, are defended by persons who have only natural interests at
heart; because these persons lack that speculative freedom and dramatic
imagination which would allow them to conceive other moulds for morality
and happiness than those to which a respectable tradition has accustomed
them. Sceptical statesmen and academic scholars sometimes suffer from
this kind of numbness; it is intelligible that they should mistake <a name="Page_300" id="Page_300" />the
forms of culture for its principle, especially when their genius is not
original and their chosen function is to defend and propagate the local
traditions in which their whole training has immersed them. Indeed, in
the political field, such concern for decaying myths may have a pathetic
justification; for however little the life of or dignity of man may he
jeopardised by changes in language, languages themselves are not
indifferent things. They may be closely bound up with the peculiar
history and spirit of nations, and their disappearance, however
necessary and on the whole propitious, may mark the end of some stirring
chapter in the world's history. Those whose vocation is not philosophy
and whose country is not the world may be pardoned for wishing to retard
the migrations of spirit, and for looking forward with apprehension to a
future in which their private enthusiasms will not be understood.</p>

<p>The value of post-rational morality, then, depends on a double
conformity on its part with the Life of Reason. In the first place some
natural impulse must be retained, some partial ideal must still be
trusted and pursued by the prophet of redemption. In the second place
the intuition thus gained and exclusively put forward must be made the
starting-point for a restored natural morality. Otherwise the faith
appealed to would be worthless in its operation, as well as fanciful in
its basis, and it could never become a mould for thought or action in a
civilised society.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI" /><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301" />CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p style='text-align: center;'>THE VALIDITY OF SCIENCE</p>


<p>The same despair or confusion which, when it overtakes human purposes,
seeks relief in arbitrary schemes of salvation, when it overtakes human
knowledge, may breed arbitrary substitutes for science. There are
post-rational systems of nature as well as of duty. Most of these are
myths hardly worth separating from the post-rational moralities they
adorn, and have been sufficiently noticed in the last chapter; but a few
aspire to be critical revisions of science, themselves scientific. It
may be well, in bringing this book to a close, to review these proposed
revisions. The validity of science is at stake, and with it the validity
of that whole Life of Reason which science crowns, and justifies to
reflection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Various modes of revising science.</div>

<p>There are many degrees and kinds of this critical retractation. Science
may be accepted bodily, while its present results are modified by
suggesting speculatively what its ultimate results might be. This is
natural philosophy or legitimate metaphysics. Or science may be accepted
in part, and in part subjected to control by some other alleged vehicle
of knowledge. This is traditional or in<a name="Page_302" id="Page_302" />tuitive theology. Or science may
be retracted and withdrawn altogether, on the ground that it is but
methodological fiction, its facts appearances merely, and its principles
tendencies to feign. This is transcendentalism; whereupon a dilemma
presents itself. We may be invited to abstain from all hypostasis or
hearty belief in anything, and to dwell only on the consciousness of
imaginative activity in a vacuum&mdash;which is radical idealism. Or we may
be assured that, science being a dream, we may awake from it into
another cosmos, built upon principles quite alien to those illustrated
in nature or applicable in practice&mdash;which is idealism of the mythical
sort. Finally it may occur to us that the criticism of science is an
integral part of science itself, and that a transcendental method of
survey, which marshals all things in the order of their discovery, far
from invalidating knowledge can only serve to separate it from
incidental errors and to disclose the relative importance of truths.
Science would then be rehabilitated by criticism. The primary movement
of the intellect would not be condemned by that subsequent reflection
which it makes possible, and which collates its results. Science, purged
of all needless realism and seen in its relation to human life, would
continue to offer the only conception of reality which is pertinent or
possible to the practical mind.</p>

<p>We may now proceed to discuss these various attitudes in turn.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303" />Science its own best critic.</div>

<p>A first and quite blameless way of criticising science is to point out
that science is incomplete. That it grows fast is indeed its commonest
boast; and no man of science is so pessimistic as to suppose that its
growth is over. To wish to supplement science and to regard its
conclusions as largely provisional is therefore more than legitimate. It
is actually to share the spirit of inquiry and to feel the impulse
toward investigation. When new truths come into view, old truths are
thereby reinterpreted and put in a new light; so that the acquisitions
of science not only admit of revision but loudly call for it, not
wishing for any other authority or vindication than that which they
might find in the context of universal truth.</p>

<p>To revise science in this spirit would be merely to extend it. No new
method, no transverse philosophy, would be requisite or fitted for the
task. Knowledge would be transformed by more similar knowledge, not by
some verbal manipulation. Yet while waiting for experience to grow and
accumulate its lessons, a man of genius, who had drunk deep of
experience himself, might imagine some ultimate synthesis. He might
venture to carry out the suggestions of science and anticipate the
conclusions it would reach when completed. The game is certainly
dangerous, especially if the prophecy is uttered with any air of
authority; yet with good luck and a fine instinct, such speculation may
actually open the way to <a name="Page_304" id="Page_304" />discovery and may diffuse in advance that
virtual knowledge of physics which is enough for moral and poetic
purposes. Verification in detail is needed, not so much for its own sake
as to check speculative errors; but when speculation is by chance well
directed and hits upon the substantial truth, it does all that a
completed science would do for mankind; since science, if ever
completed, would immediately have to be summed up again and reduced to
generalities. Under the circumstances of human life, ultimate truth must
forego detailed verification and must remain speculative. The curse of
modern philosophy is only that it has not drawn its inspiration from
science; as the misfortune of science is that it has not yet saturated
the mind of philosophers and recast the moral world. The Greek
physicists, puerile as was their notion of natural mechanism, had a more
integral view of things. They understood nature's uses and man's
conditions in an honest and noble way. If no single phenomenon had been
explained correctly by any philosopher from Thales to Lucretius, yet by
their frank and studious contemplation of nature they would have
liberated the human soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Obstruction by alien traditions.</div>

<p>Unfortunately the supplements to science which most philosophers supply
in our day are not conceived in a scientific spirit. Instead of
anticipating the physics of the future they cling to the physics of the
past. They do not stimulate us by a picture, <a name="Page_305" id="Page_305" />however fanciful, of what
the analogies of nature and politics actually point to; they seek rather
to patch and dislocate current physics with some ancient myth, once the
best physics obtainable, from which they have not learned to extricate
their affections.</p>

<p>Sometimes these survivals are intended to modify scientific conceptions
but slightly, and merely to soften a little the outlines of a cosmic
picture to which religion and literature are not yet accustomed. There
is a school of political conservatives who, with no specific interest in
metaphysics, cannot or dare not break with traditional modes of
expression, with the customs of their nation, or with the clerical
classes. They accordingly append to current knowledge certain
sentimental postulates, alleging that what is established by tradition
and what appeals to the heart must somehow correspond to something which
is needful and true. But their conventional attachment to a religion
which in its original essence was perhaps mystical and revolutionary,
scarcely modifies, in their eyes, the sum of practical assurances or the
aim of human life. As language exercises some functions which science
can hardly assume (as, for instance, in poetry and communication) so
theology and metaphysics, which to such men are nothing but languages,
might provide for inarticulate interests, and unite us to much that lies
in the dim penumbra of our workaday world. Ancient revelations and
mys<a name="Page_306" id="Page_306" />teries, however incredible if taken literally, might therefore be
suffered to nourish undisturbed, so long as they did not clash with any
clear fact or natural duty. They might continue to decorate with a
mystical aureole the too prosaic kernel of known truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Needless anxiety for moral interests.</div>

<p>Mythology and ritual, with the sundry divinations of poets, might in
fact be kept suspended with advantage over human passion and ignorance,
to furnish them with decent expression. But once indulged, divination is
apt to grow arrogant and dogmatic. When its oracles have become
traditional they are almost inevitably mistaken for sober truths. Hence
the second kind of supplement offered to science, so that revelations
with which moral life has been intertwined may find a place beside or
beyond science. The effort is honest, but extraordinarily short-sighted.
Whatever value those revelations may have they draw from actual
experience or inevitable ideals. When the ground of that experience and
those ideals is disclosed by science, nothing of any value is lost; it
only remains to accustom ourselves to a new vocabulary and to shift
somewhat the associations of those values which life contains or
pursues. Revelations are necessarily mythical and subrational; they
express natural forces and human interests in a groping way, before the
advent of science. To stick in them, when something more honest and
explicit is available, is in<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307" />consistent with caring for attainable
welfare or understanding the situation. It is to be stubborn and
negligent under the cloak of religion. These prejudices are a drag on
progress, moral no less than material; and the sensitive conservatism
that fears they may be indispensable is entangled in a pathetic
delusion. It is conservatism in a ship-wreck. It has not the insight to
embrace the fertile principles of life, which are always ready to renew
life after no matter what natural catastrophe. The good laggards have no
courage to strip for the race. Rather than live otherwise, and live
better, they prefer to nurse the memories of youth and to die with a
retrospective smile upon their countenance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Science an imaginative and practical art.</div>

<p>Far graver than the criticism which shows science to be incomplete is
that which shows it to be relative. The fact is undeniable, though the
inferences made from it are often rash and gratuitous. We have seen that
science is nothing but developed perception, interpreted intent,
common-sense rounded out and minutely articulated. It is therefore as
much an instinctive product, as much a stepping forth of human courage
in the dark, as is any inevitable dream or impulsive action. Like life
itself, like any form of determinate existence, it is altogether
autonomous and unjustifiable from the outside. It must lean on its own
vitality; to sanction reason there is only reason, and to corroborate
sense there is nothing <a name="Page_308" id="Page_308" />but sense. Inferential thought is a venture not
to be approved of, save by a thought no less venturesome and
inferential. This is once for all the fate of a living being&mdash;it is the
very essence of spirit&mdash;to be ever on the wing, borne by inner forces
toward goals of its own imagining, confined to a passing apprehension of
a represented world. Mind, which calls itself the organ of truth, is a
permanent possibility of error. The encouragement and corroboration
which science is alleged to receive from moment to moment may, for aught
it knows, be simply a more ingenious self-deception, a form of that
cumulative illusion by which madness can confirm itself, creating a
whole world, with an endless series of martyrs, to bear witness to its
sanity.</p>

<p>To insist on this situation may seem idle, since no positive doctrine
can gain thereby in plausibility, and no particular line of action in
reasonableness. Yet this transcendental exercise, this reversion to the
immediate, may be recommended by way of a cathartic, to free the mind
from ancient obstructions and make it hungrier and more agile in its
rational faith. Scepticism is harmless when it is honest and universal;
it clears the air and is a means of reorganising belief on its natural
foundations. Belief is an inevitable accompaniment of practice and
intent, both of which it will cling to all the more closely after a
thorough criticism. When all beliefs are challenged together, the just
and necessary ones <a name="Page_309" id="Page_309" />have a chance to step forward and to re-establish
themselves alone. The doubt cast on science, when it is an ingenuous and
impartial doubt, will accordingly serve to show what sort of thing
science is, and to establish it on a sure foundation. Science will then
be seen to be tentative, genial, practical, and humane, full of ideality
and pathos, like every great human undertaking.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arri&egrave;re-pens&eacute;e in transcendentalism.</div>

<p>Unfortunately a searching disintegration of dogma, a conscientious
reversion to the immediate, is seldom practised for its own sake. So
violent a disturbance of mental habits needs some great social upheaval
or some revolutionary ambition to bring it about. The transcendental
philosophy might never have been put forward at all, had its authors
valued it for what it can really accomplish. The effort would have
seemed too great and the result too nugatory. Their criticism of
knowledge was not freely undertaken, with the pure speculative motive of
understanding and purifying human science. They were driven on by the
malicious psychology of their predecessors, by the perplexities of a
sophistical scepticism, and by the imminent collapse of traditional
metaphysics. They were enticed at the same time by the hope of finding a
new basis for the religious myths associated with that metaphysics. In
consequence their transcendentalism was not a rehearsal of the Life of
Reason, a retrospect criticising and justifying the phases of human
<a name="Page_310" id="Page_310" />progress. It was rather a post-rational system of theology, the
dangerous cure to a harmless disease, inducing a panic to introduce a
fable. The panic came from the assumption (a wholly gratuitous one) that
a spontaneous constructive intellect cannot be a trustworthy instrument,
that appearances cannot be the properties of reality, and that things
cannot be what science finds that they are. We were forbidden to believe
in anything we might discover or to trust in anything we could see. The
artificial vacuum thus produced in the mind ached to be filled with
something, and of course a flood of rhetorical commonplaces was at hand,
which might rush in to fill it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its romantic sincerity.</div>

<p>The most heroic transcendentalists were but men, and having imagined
that logic obliged them to abstain from every sort of hypostasis, they
could not long remain true to their logic. For a time, being of a
buoyant disposition, they might feel that nothing could be more
exhilarating than to swim in the void, altogether free from settled
conditions, altogether the ignorant creators of each moment's vision.
Such a career evidently affords all sorts of possibilities, except
perhaps the possibility of being a career. But when a man has strained
every nerve to maintain an absolute fluidity and a painful fidelity to
the immediate, he can hardly be blamed if he lapses at last into some
flattering myth, and if having satisfied himself that all sci<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311" />ence is
fiction he proclaims some fairy-tale to be the truth. The episodes of
experience, not being due to any conceivable machinery beneath, might
come of mere willing, or at the waving of a dialectical wand. Yet apart
from this ulterior inconsistency and backsliding into credulity,
transcendentalism would hear nothing of causes or grounds. All phenomena
existed for it on one flat level. We were released from all dogma and
reinstated in the primordial assurance that we were all there was, but
without understanding what we were, and without any means of controlling
our destiny, though cheered by the magnificent feeling that that destiny
was great.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its constructive importance.</div>

<p>It is intelligible that a pure transcendentalism of this sort should not
be either stable or popular. It may be admired for its analytic depth
and its persistency in tracing all supposed existences back to the
experience that vouches for them. Yet a spirit that finds its only
exercise in gloating on the consciousness that it is a spirit, one that
has so little skill in expression that it feels all its embodiments to
be betrayals and all its symbols to be misrepresentations, is a spirit
evidently impotent and confused. It is self-inhibited, and cannot fulfil
its essential vocation by reaching an embodiment at once definitive and
ideal, philosophical and true. We may excuse a school that has done one
original task so thoroughly as transcendentalism has <a name="Page_312" id="Page_312" />thing could be
said of it, would be simply an integral term in the discourse that
described it. And this discourse, this sad residuum of reality, would
remain an absolute datum without a ground, without a subject-matter,
without a past, and without a future.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its futility.</div>

<p>It suffices, therefore, to take the supposed negative implication in
transcendentalism a little seriously to see that it leaves nothing
standing but negation and imbecility; so that we may safely conclude
that such a negative implication is gratuitous, and also that in taking
the transcendental method for an instrument of reconstruction its
professors were radically false to it. They took the starting-point of
experience, on which they had fallen back, for its ultimate deliverance,
and in reverting to protoplasm they thought they were rising to God. The
transcendental method is merely retrospective; its use is to recover
more systematically conceptions already extant and inevitable. It
invalidates nothing in science; much less does it carry with it any
rival doctrine of its own. Every philosophy, even materialism, may find
a transcendental justification, if experience as it develops will yield
no other terms. What has reason to tremble at a demand for its
credentials is surely not natural science; it is rather those mystical
theologies or romantic philosophies of history which aspire to take its
place. Such lucubrations, even if reputed certain, can scarcely be
<a name="Page_313" id="Page_313" />really credited or regarded in practice; while scientific tenets are
necessarily respected, even when they are declared to be fictions. This
nemesis is inevitable; for the mind must be inhabited, and the ideas
with which science peoples it are simply its involuntary perceptions
somewhat more clearly arranged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ideal science is self-justified.</div>

<p>That the relativity of science&mdash;its being an emanation of human life&mdash;is
nothing against its truth appears best, perhaps, in the case of
dialectic. Dialectic is valid by virtue of an intended meaning and felt
congruity in its terms; but these terms, which intent fixes, are
external and independent in their ideal nature, and the congruity
between them is not created by being felt but, whether incidentally felt
or not, is inherent in their essence. Mathematical thinking is the
closest and most intimate of mental operations, nothing external being
called in to aid; yet mathematical truth is as remote as possible from
being personal or psychic. It is absolutely self-justified and is
necessary before it is discovered to be so. Here, then, is a conspicuous
region of truth, disclosed to the human intellect by its own internal
exercise, which is nevertheless altogether independent, being eternal
and indefeasible, while the thought that utters it is ephemeral.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical science is presupposed in scepticism.</div>

<p>The validity of material science, not being warranted by pure insight,
cannot be so quickly made out; nevertheless it cannot be denied
systemati<a name="Page_314" id="Page_314" />cally, and the misunderstood transcendentalism which belittles
physics contradicts its own basis. For how are we supposed to know that
what call facts are mere appearances and what we call objects mere
creations of thought? We know this by physics. It is physiology, a part
of physics, that assures us that our senses and brains are conditions of
our experience. Were it not for what we know of the outer world and of
our place in it, we should be incapable of attaching any meaning to
subjectivity. The flux of things would then go on in their own medium,
not in our minds; and no suspicion of illusion or of qualification by
mind would attach to any event in nature. So it is in a dream; and it is
our knowledge of physics, our reliance on the world's material
coherence, that marks our awakening, and that constitutes our discovery
that we exist as minds and are subject to dreaming. It is quite true
that the flux, as it exists in men, is largely psychic; but only because
the events it contains are effects of material causes and the images in
it are flying shadows cast by solid external things. This is the meaning
of psychic existence, and its differentia. Mind is an expression,
weighted with emotion, of mechanical relations among bodies. Suppose the
bodies all removed: at once the images formerly contrasted with those
bodies would resume their inherent characteristics and mutual relation;
they would become existences in their <a name="Page_315" id="Page_315" />own category, large, moving,
coloured, distributed to right and left; that is, save for their values,
they would become material things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It recurs in all understanding of perception.</div>

<p>Physics is accordingly a science which, though hypothetical and only
verifiable by experiment, is involved in history and psychology and
therefore in any criticism of knowledge. The contradiction would be
curious if a man should declare that his ideas were worthless, being due
to his organs of sense, and that therefore these organs (since he had an
idea of them) did not exist. Yet on this brave argument idealism chiefly
rests. It asserts that bodies are mere ideas, because it is through our
bodies that we perceive them. When physics has discovered the conditions
under which knowledge of physics has arisen, physics is supposed to be
spirited away; whereas, of course, it has only closed its circle and
justified its sovereignty. Were all science retracted and reduced to
symbolic calculation nothing would remain for this calculation to
symbolise. The whole force of calling a theory merely a vehicle or
method of thought, leading us to something different from itself, lies
in having a literal knowledge of this other thing. But such literal
knowledge is the first stage of science, which the other stages merely
extend. So that when, under special circumstances, we really appeal to
algebraic methods of expression and think in symbols, we do so in the
hope of transcribing our terms, <a name="Page_316" id="Page_316" />when the reckoning is over, into the
language of familiar facts. Were these facts not forthcoming, the
symbolic machinery would itself become the genuine reality&mdash;since it is
really given&mdash;and we should have to rest in it, as in the ultimate
truth. This is what happens in mythology, when the natural phenomena
expressed by it are forgotten. But natural phenomena themselves are
symbols of nothing, because they are primary data. They are the
constitutive elements of the reality they disclose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Science contains all trustworthy knowledge.</div>

<p>The validity of science in general is accordingly established merely by
establishing the truth of its particular propositions, in dialectic on
the authority of intent and in physics on that of experiment. It is
impossible to base science on a deeper foundation or to override it by a
higher knowledge. What is called metaphysics, if not an anticipation of
natural science, is a confusion of it with dialectic or a mixture of it
with myths. If we have the faculty of being utterly sincere and of
disintegrating the conventions of language and religion, we must confess
that knowledge is only a claim we put forth, a part of that unfathomable
compulsion by force of which we live and hold our painted world together
for a moment. If we have any insight into mind, or any eye for human
history, we must confess at the same time that the oracular substitutes
for knowledge to which, in our perplexities, we might be tempted <a name="Page_317" id="Page_317" />to
fly, are pathetic popular fables, having no other sanctity than that
which they borrow from the natural impulses they play upon. To live by
science requires intelligence and faith, but not to live by it is folly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It suffices for the Life of Reason.</div>

<p>If science thus contains the sum total of our rational convictions and
gives us the only picture of reality on which we should care to dwell,
we have but to consult the sciences in detail to ascertain, as far as
that is possible, what sort of a universe we live in. The result is as
yet far from satisfactory. The sciences have not joined hands and made
their results coherent, showing nature to be, as it doubtless is, all of
one piece. The moral sciences especially are a mass of confusion.
Negative, I think, must be the attitude of reason, in the present state
of science, upon any hypothesis far outrunning the recorded history and
the visible habitat of the human race. Yet exactly the same habits and
principles that have secured our present knowledge are still active
within us, and promise further discoveries. It is more desirable to
clarify our knowledge within these bounds than to extend it beyond them.
For while the reward of action is contemplation or, in more modern
phrase, experience and consciousness, there is nothing stable or
interesting to contemplate except objects relevant to action&mdash;the
natural world and the mind's ideals.</p>

<p>Both the conditions and the standards of ac<a name="Page_318" id="Page_318" />tion lie well within the
territory which science, after a fashion, already dominates. But there
remain unexplored jungles and monster-breeding lairs within our nominal
jurisdiction which it is the immediate task of science to clear. The
darkest spots are in man himself, in his fitful, irrational disposition.
Could a better system prevail in our lives a better order would
establish itself in our thinking. It has not been for want of keen
senses, or personal genius, or a constant order in the outer world, that
mankind have fallen back repeatedly into barbarism and superstition. It
has been for want of good character, good example, and good government.
There is a pathetic capacity in men to live nobly, if only they would
give one another the chance. The ideal of political perfection, vague
and remote as it yet seems, is certainly approachable, for it is as
definite and constant as human nature. The knowledge of all relevant
truth would be involved in that ideal, and no intellectual
dissatisfaction would be felt with a system of ideas that should express
and illumine a perfect life.</p>
