<p style='text-align: center;'>HOW RELIGION MAY BE AN EMBODIMENT OF REASON</p>


<div class="sidenote">Religion certainly significant.</div>

<p>Experience has repeatedly confirmed that well-known maxim of Bacon's,
that &quot;a little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism, but depth in
philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion.&quot; In every age the
most comprehensive thinkers have found in the religion of their time and
country something they could accept, interpreting and illustrating that
religion so as to give it depth and universal application. Even the
heretics and atheists, if they have had profundity, turn out after a
while to be forerunners of some new orthodoxy. What they rebel against
is a religion alien to their nature; they are atheists only by accident,
and relatively to a convention which inwardly offends them, but they
yearn mightily in their own souls after the religious acceptance of a
world interpreted in their own fashion. So it appears in the end that
their atheism and loud protestation were in fact the hastier part of
their thought, since what emboldened them to deny the poor world's faith
was that they were too impatient to understand it. Indeed, <a name="Page_4" id="Page_4" />the
enlightenment common to young wits and worm-eaten old satirists, who
plume themselves on detecting the scientific ineptitude of
religion&mdash;something which the blindest half see&mdash;is not nearly
enlightened enough: it points to notorious facts incompatible with
religious tenets literally taken, but it leaves unexplored the habits of
thought from which those tenets sprang, their original meaning, and
their true function. Such studies would bring the sceptic face to face
with the mystery and pathos of mortal existence. They would make him
understand why religion is so profoundly moving and in a sense so
profoundly just. There must needs be something humane and necessary in
an influence that has become the most general sanction of virtue, the
chief occasion for; art and philosophy, and the source, perhaps, of the
best human happiness. If nothing, as Hooker said, is &quot;so malapert as a
splenetic religion,&quot; a sour irreligion is almost as perverse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But not literally true.</div>

<p>At the same time, when Bacon penned the sage epigram we have quoted he
forgot to add that the God to whom depth in philosophy brings back men's
minds is far from being the same from whom a little philosophy estranges
them. It would be pitiful indeed if mature reflection bred no better
conceptions than those which have drifted down the muddy stream of time,
where tradition and passion have jumbled everything together.
Traditional conceptions, when they are felicitous, may be adopted by the
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5" />poet, but they must be purified by the moralist and disintegrated by
the philosopher. Each religion, so dear to those whose life it
sanctifies, and fulfilling so necessary a function in the society that
has adopted it, necessarily contradicts every other religion, and
probably contradicts itself. What religion a man shall have is a
historical accident, quite as much as what language he shall speak. In
the rare circumstances where a choice is possible, he may, with some
difficulty, make an exchange; but even then he is only adopting a new
convention which may be more agreeable to his personal temper but which
is essentially as arbitrary as the old.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All religion is positive and particular.</div>

<p>The attempt to speak without speaking any particular language is not
more hopeless than the attempt to have a religion that shall be no
religion in particular. A courier's or a dragoman's speech may indeed be
often unusual and drawn from disparate sources, not without some mixture
of personal originality; but that private jargon will have a meaning
only because of its analogy to one or more conventional languages and
its obvious derivation from them. So travellers from one religion to
another, people who have lost their spiritual nationality, may often
retain a neutral and confused residuum of belief, which they may
egregiously regard as the essence of all religion, so little may they
remember the graciousness and naturalness of that ancestral accent which
a perfect religion should have. Yet a <a name="Page_6" id="Page_6" />moment's probing of the
conceptions surviving in such minds will show them to be nothing but
vestiges of old beliefs, creases which thought, even if emptied of all
dogmatic tenets, has not been able to smooth away at its first
unfolding. Later generations, if they have any religion at all, will be
found either to revert to ancient authority, or to attach themselves
spontaneously to something wholly novel and immensely positive, to some
faith promulgated by a fresh genius and passionately embraced by a
converted people. Thus every living and healthy religion has a marked
idiosyncrasy. Its power consists in its special and surprising message
and in the bias which that revelation gives to life. The vistas it opens
and the mysteries propounds are another world to live in; and another
world to live in&mdash;whether we expect ever to pass wholly into it or
no&mdash;is what we mean by having a religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It aims at the Life of Reason.</div>

<p>What relation, then, does this great business of the soul, which we call
religion, bear to the Life of Reason? That the relation between the two
is close seems clear from several circumstances. The Life of Reason is
the seat of all ultimate values. Now the history of mankind will show us
that whenever spirits at once lofty and intense have seemed to attain
the highest joys, they have envisaged and attained them in religion.
Religion would therefore seem to be a vehicle or a factor in rational
life, since the ends of rational life are attained <a name="Page_7" id="Page_7" />by it. Moreover, the
Life of Reason is an ideal to which everything in the world should be
subordinated; it establishes lines of moral cleavage everywhere and
makes right eternally different from wrong. Religion does the same
thing. It makes absolute moral decisions. It sanctions, unifies, and
transforms ethics. Religion thus exercises a function of the Life of
Reason. And a further function which is common to both is that of
emancipating man from his personal limitations. In different ways
religions promise to transfer the soul to better conditions. A
supernaturally favoured kingdom is to be established for posterity upon
earth, or for all the faithful in heaven, or the soul is to be freed by
repeated purgations from all taint and sorrow, or it is to be lost in
the absolute, or it is to become an influence and an object of adoration
in the places it once haunted or wherever the activities it once loved
may be carried on by future generations of its kindred. Now reason in
its way lays before us all these possibilities: it points to common
objects, political and intellectual, in which an individual may lose
what is mortal and accidental in himself and immortalise what is
rational and human; it teaches us how sweet and fortunate death may be
to those whose spirit can still live in their country and in their
ideas; it reveals the radiating effects of action and the eternal
objects of thought.</p>

<p>Yet the difference in tone and language must strike us, so soon as it is
philosophy that speaks. <a name="Page_8" id="Page_8" />That change should remind us that even if the
function of religion and that of reason coincide, this function is
performed in the two cases by very different organs. Religions are many,
reason one. Religion consists of conscious ideas, hopes, enthusiasms,
and objects of worship; it operates by grace and flourished by prayer.
Reason, on the other hand, is a mere principle or potential order, on
which, indeed, we may come to reflect, but which exists in us ideally
only, without variation or stress of any kind. We conform or do not
conform to it; it does not urge or chide us, nor call for any emotions
on our part other than those naturally aroused by the various objects
which it unfolds in their true nature and proportion. Religion brings
some order into life by weighting it with new materials. Reason adds to
the natural materials only the perfect order which it introduces into
them. Rationality is nothing but a form, an ideal constitution which
experience may more or less embody. Religion is a part of experience
itself, a mass of sentiments and ideas. The one is an inviolate
principle, the other a changing and struggling force. And yet this
struggling and changing force of religion, seems to direct man toward
something eternal. It seems to make for an ultimate harmony within the
soul and for an ultimate harmony between the soul and all the soul
depends upon. So that religion, in its intent, is a more conscious and
direct pursuit of the Life of Reason than is society, science, or art.
For <a name="Page_9" id="Page_9" />these approach and fill out the ideal life tentatively and
piecemeal, hardly regarding the goal or caring for the ultimate
justification of their instinctive aims. Religion also has an
instinctive and blind side, and bubbles up in all manner of chance
practices and intuitions; soon, however, it feels its way toward the
heart of things, and, from whatever quarter it may come, veers in the
direction of the ultimate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But largely fails to attain it.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, we must confess that this religious pursuit of the Life of
Reason has been singularly abortive. Those within the pale of each
religion may prevail upon themselves to express satisfaction with its
results, thanks to a fond partiality in reading the past and generous
draughts of hope for the future; but any one regarding the various
religions at once and comparing their achievements with what reason
requires, must feel how terrible is the disappointment which they have
one and all prepared for mankind. Their chief anxiety has been to offer
imaginary remedies for mortal ills, some of which are incurable
essentially, while others might have been really cured by well-directed
effort. The Greek oracles, for instance, pretended to heal our natural
ignorance, which has its appropriate though difficult cure, while the
Christian vision of heaven pretended to be an antidote to our natural
death, the inevitable correlate of birth and of a changing and
conditioned existence. By methods of this sort little can be done for
the <a name="Page_10" id="Page_10" />real betterment of life. To confuse intelligence and dislocate
sentiment by gratuitous fictions is a short-sighted way of pursuing
happiness. Nature is soon avenged. An unhealthy exaltation and a
one-sided morality have to be followed by regrettable reactions. When
these come, the real rewards of life may seem vain to a relaxed
vitality, and the very name of virtue may irritate young spirits
untrained in any natural excellence. Thus religion too often debauches
the morality it comes to sanction, and impedes the science it ought to
fulfil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its approach imaginative.</div>

<p>What is the secret of this ineptitude? Why does religion, so near to
rationality in its purpose, fall so far short of it in its texture and
in its results? The answer is easy: Religion pursues, rationality
through the imagination. When it explains events or assigns causes, it
gives imaginative substitute for science. When it gives; precepts,
insinuates ideals, or remoulds aspiration, it is an imaginative
substitute for wisdom&mdash;I mean for the deliberate and impartial pursuit
of all good. The conditions and the aims of life are both represented in
religion poetically, but this poetry tends to arrogate to itself literal
truth and moral authority, neither of which it possesses. Hence the
depth and importance of religion become intelligible no less than its
contradictions and practical disasters. Its object is the same as that
of reason, but its method is to proceed by intuition and by unchecked
poetical conceits. These are repeated and vulgarised in proportion to
their original fineness and <a name="Page_11" id="Page_11" />significance, till they pass for reports of
objective truth and come to constitute a world of faith, superposed upon
the world of experience and regarded as materially enveloping it, if not
in space at least in time and in existence. The only truth of religion
comes from its interpretation of life, from its symbolic rendering of
that moral, experience which it springs out of and which it seeks to
elucidate. Its falsehood comes from the insidious misunderstanding which
clings to it, to the effect that these poetic conceptions are not merely
representations of experience as it is or should be, but are rather
information about experience or reality elsewhere&mdash;an experience and
reality which, strangely enough, supply just the defects betrayed by
reality and experience here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When its poetic method is denied its value is jeopardised.</div>

<p>Thus religion has the same original relation to life that poetry has;
only poetry, which never pretends to literal validity, adds a pure value
to existence, the value of a liberal imaginative exercise. The poetic
value of religion would initially be greater than that of poetry itself,
because religion deals with higher and more practical themes, with sides
of life which are in greater need of some imaginative touch and ideal
interpretation than are those pleasant or pompous things which ordinary
poetry dwells upon. But this initial advantage is neutralised in part by
the abuse to which religion is subject, whenever its symbolic rightness
is taken for scientific truth. Like poetry, it improves <a name="Page_12" id="Page_12" />the world only
by imagining it improved, but not content with making this addition to
the mind's furniture&mdash;an addition which might be useful and
ennobling&mdash;it thinks to confer a more radical benefit by persuading
mankind that, in spite of appearances, the world is really such as that
rather arbitrary idealisation has painted it. This spurious satisfaction
is naturally the prelude to many a disappointment, and the soul has
infinite trouble to emerge again from the artificial problems and
sentiments into which it is thus plunged. The value of religion becomes
equivocal. Religion remains an imaginative achievement, a symbolic
representation of moral reality which may have a most important function
in vitalising the mind and in transmitting, by way of parables, the
lessons of experience. But it becomes at the same time a continuous
incidental deception; and this deception, in proportion as it is
strenuously denied to be such, can work indefinite harm in the world and
in the conscience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It precedes science rather than hinders it.</div>

<p>On the whole, however, religion should not be conceived as having taken
the place of anything better, but rather as having come to relieve
situations which, but for its presence, would have been infinitely
worse. In the thick of active life, or in the monotony of practical
slavery, there is more need to stimulate fancy than to control it.
Natural instinct is not much disturbed in the human brain by what may
happen in that thin superstra<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" />tum of ideas which commonly overlays it.
We must not blame religion for preventing the development of a moral and
natural science which at any rate would seldom have appeared; we must
rather thank it for the sensibility, the reverence, the speculative
insight which it has introduced into the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is merely symbolic and thoroughly human.</div>

<p>We may therefore proceed to analyse the significance and the function
which religion has had at its different stages, and, without disguising
or in the least condoning its confusion with literal truth, we may allow
ourselves to enter as sympathetically as possible into its various
conceptions and emotions. They have made up the inner life of many
sages, and of all those who without great genius or learning have lived
steadfastly in the spirit. The feeling of reverence should itself be
treated with reverence, although not at a sacrifice of truth, with which
alone, in the end, reverence is compatible. Nor have we any reason to be
intolerant of the partialities and contradictions which religions
display. Were we dealing with a science, such contradictions would have
to be instantly solved and removed; but when we are concerned with the
poetic interpretation of experience, contradiction means only variety,
and variety means spontaneity, wealth of resource, and a nearer approach
to total adequacy.</p>

<p>If we hope to gain any understanding of these matters we must begin by
taking them out of that heated and fanatical atmosphere in which the
He<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" />brew tradition has enveloped them. The Jews had no philosophy, and
when their national traditions came to be theoretically explicated and
justified, they were made to issue in a puerile scholasticism and a
rabid intolerance. The question of monotheism, for instance, was a
terrible question to the Jews. Idolatry did not consist in worshipping a
god who, not being ideal, might be unworthy of worship, but rather in
recognising other gods than the one worshipped in Jerusalem. To the
Greeks, on the contrary, whose philosophy was enlightened and ingenuous,
monotheism and polytheism seemed perfectly innocent and compatible. To
say God or the gods was only to use different expressions for the same
influence, now viewed in its abstract unity and correlation with all
existence, now viewed in its various manifestations in moral life, in
nature, or in history. So that what in Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics
meets us at every step&mdash;the combination of monotheism with
polytheism&mdash;is no contradiction, but merely an intelligent variation of
phrase to indicate various aspects or functions in physical and moral
things. When religion appears to us in this light its contradictions and
controversies lose all their bitterness. Each doctrine will simply
represent the moral plane on which they live who have devised or adopted
it. Religions will thus be better or worse, never true or false. We
shall be able to lend ourselves to each in turn, and seek to draw from
it the secret of its inspiration.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>RATIONAL ELEMENTS IN SUPERSTITION</p>


<p>We need not impose upon ourselves the endless and repulsive task of
describing all the superstitions that have existed in the world. In his
impotence and laziness the natural man unites any notion with any other
in a loose causal relation. A single instance of juxtaposition, nay, the
mere notion and dream of such a combination, will suffice to arouse fear
or to prompt experimental action.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Felt causes not necessary causes.</div>

<p>When philosophers have objected to Hume's account of causation that he
gave no sufficient basis for the <i>necessary</i> influence of cause on
effect, they have indulged in a highly artificial supposition. They have
assumed that people actually regard causes as necessary. They suppose
that before we can feel the interdependence of two things in experience
we must have an unshakable conviction that their connection is necessary
and universal. But causation in such an absolute sense is no category of
practical thinking. It appears, if at all, only in dialectic, in ideal
applications of given laws to cases artificially simplified, where the
terms are so defined that their operation upon one another is <a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" />involved
in the notion of them. So if we say that an unsupported weight <i>must</i>
fall to the ground, we have included in the word &quot;weight&quot; the notion of
a downward strain. The proposition is really trifling and identical. It
merely announces that things which tend to fall to the ground tend to
fall to the ground, and that heavy things are heavy. So, when we have
called a thing a cause, we have defined it as that which involves an
effect, and if the effect did not follow, the title of cause would no
longer belong to the antecedent. But the necessity of this sequence is
merely verbal. We have never, in the presence of the antecedent, the
assurance that the title of cause will accrue to it. Our expectation is
empirical, and we feel and assert nothing in respect to the necessity of
the expected sequence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mechanism and dialectic ulterior principles.</div>

<p>A cause, in real life, means a justifying circumstance. We are
absolutely without insight into the machinery of causation, notably in
the commonest cases, like that of generation, nutrition, or the
operation of mind on matter. But we are familiar with the more notable
superficial conditions in each case, and the appearance in part of any
usual phenomenon makes us look for the rest of it. We do not ordinarily
expect virgins to bear children nor prophets to be fed by ravens nor
prayers to remove mountains; but we may believe any of these things at
the merest suggestion of fancy or report, without any warrant from
experience, so loose is the bond and so external the relation between
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" />the terms most constantly associated. A quite unprecedented occurrence
will seem natural and intelligible enough if it falls in happily with
the current of our thoughts. Interesting and significant events,
however, are so rare and so dependent on mechanical conditions
irrelevant to their value, that we come at last to wonder at their
self-justified appearance apart from that cumbrous natural machinery,
and to call them marvels, miracles, and things to gape at. We come to
adopt scientific hypotheses, at least in certain provinces of our
thought, and we lose our primitive openness and simplicity of mind.
Then, with an unjustified haste, we assert that miracles are impossible,
i.e., that nothing interesting and fundamentally natural can happen
unless all the usual, though adventitious, <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i> has been
prepared behind the curtain.</p>

<p>The philosopher may eventually discover that such machinery is really
needed and that even the actors themselves have a mechanism within them,
so that not only their smiles and magnificent gestures, but their heated
fancy itself and their conception of their r&ocirc;les are but outer effects
and dramatic illusions produced by the natural stage-carpentry in their
brains. Yet such eventual scientific conclusions have nothing to do with
the tentative first notions of men when they begin to experiment in the
art of living. As the seeds of lower animals have to be innumerable, so
that in a chance environment a few may grow to maturity, so the <a name="Page_18" id="Page_18" />seeds
of rational thinking, the first categories of reflection, have to be
multitudinous, in order that some lucky principle of synthesis may
somewhere come to light and find successful application. Science, which
thinks to make belief in miracles impossible, is itself belief in
miracles&mdash;in the miracles best authenticated by history and by daily
life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early selection of categories.</div>

<p>When men begin to understand things, when they begin to reflect and to
plan, they divide the world into the hateful and the delightful, the
avoidable and the attainable. And in feeling their way toward what
attracts them, or in escaping what they fear, they at first follow
passively the lead of instinct: they watch themselves live, or rather
sink without reserve into their living; their reactions are as little
foreseen and as naturally accepted as their surroundings. Their ideas
are incidents in their perpetual oscillation between apathy and passion.
The stream of animal life leaves behind a little sediment of knowledge,
the sand of that auriferous river; a few grains of experience remain to
mark the path traversed by the flood. These residual ideas and
premonitions, these first categories of thought, are of any and every
sort. All the contents of the mind and all the threads of relation that
weave its elements together are alike fitted, for all we can then see,
to give the clue to the labyrinth in which we find ourselves wandering.</p>

<p>There is <i>prima facie</i> no ground for not trying to apply to experience
such categories, for instance, <a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" />as that of personal omnipotence, as if
everything were necessarily arranged as we may command or require. On
this principle children often seem to conceive a world in which they are
astonished not to find themselves living. Or we may try aesthetic
categories and allow our reproductive imagination&mdash;by which memory is
fed&mdash;to bring under the unity of apperception only what can fall within
it harmoniously, completely, and delightfully. Such an understanding,
impervious to anything but the beautiful, might be a fine thing in
itself, but would not chronicle the fortunes of that organism to which
it was attached. It would yield an experience&mdash;doubtless a highly
interesting and elaborate experience&mdash;but one which could never serve as
an index to successful action. It would totally fail to represent its
conditions, and consequently would imply nothing about its continued
existence. It would be an experience irrelevant to conduct, no part,
therefore, of a Life of Reason, but a kind of lovely vapid music or
parasitic dream.</p>

<p>Now such dreams are in fact among the first and most absorbing
formations in the human mind. If we could penetrate into animal
consciousness we should not improbably find that what there accompanies
instinctive motions is a wholly irrelevant fancy, whose flaring up and
subsidence no doubt coincide with the presence of objects interesting to
the organism and causing marked reactions within it; yet this fancy may
in no way represent the nature of surrounding objects nor the <a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" />eventual
results, for the animal's consciousness, of its own present experience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tentative rational worlds.</div>

<p>The unlimited number of possible categories, their arbitrariness and
spontaneity, may, however, have this inconvenience, that the categories
may be irrelevant to one another no less than to the natural life they
ought to express. The experience they respectively synthesise may
therefore be no single experience. One pictured world may succeed
another in the sphere of sensibility, while the body whose sensibility
they compose moves in a single and constant physical cosmos. Each little
mental universe may be intermittent, or, if any part of it endures while
a new group of ideas comes upon the stage, there may arise
contradictions, discords, and a sense of lurking absurdity which will
tend to disrupt thought logically at the same time that the processes of
nutrition and the oncoming of new dreams tend to supplant it
mechanically. Such drifting categories have no mutual authority. They
replace but do not dominate one another, and the general conditions of
life&mdash;by conceiving which life itself might be surveyed&mdash;remain entirely
unrepresented.</p>

<p>What we mean, indeed, by the natural world in which the conditions of
consciousness are found and in reference to which mind and its purposes
can attain practical efficacy, is simply the world constructed by
categories found to yield a constant, sufficient, and consistent object.
Having attained <a name="Page_21" id="Page_21" />this conception, we justly call it the truth and
measure the intellectual value of all other constructions by their
affinity to that rational vision.</p>

<p>Such a rational vision has not yet been attained by mankind, but it
would be absurd to say that because we have not fully nor even
proximately attained it, we have not gained any conception whatever of a
reliable and intelligible world. The modicum of rationality achieved in
the sciences gives us a hint of a perfect rationality which, if
unattainable in practice, is not inconceivable in idea. So, in still
more inchoate moments of reflection, our ancestors nursed even more
isolated, less compatible, less adequate conceptions than those which
leave our philosophers still unsatisfied. The categories they employed
dominated smaller regions of experience than do the categories of
history and natural science; they had far less applicability to the
conduct of affairs and to the happy direction of life as a whole. Yet
they did yield vision and flashes of insight. They lighted men a step
ahead in the dark places of their careers, and gave them at certain
junctures a sense of creative power and moral freedom. So that the
necessity of abandoning one category in order to use a better need not
induce us to deny that the worse category could draw the outlines of a
sort of world and furnish men with an approach to wisdom. If our
ancestors, by such means, could not dominate life as a whole, neither
can we, in spite of all progress. If literal truth or final
applicabil<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" />ity cannot be claimed for their thought, who knows how many
and how profound the revolutions might be which our own thought would
have to suffer if new fields of perception or new powers of synthesis
were added to our endowment?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superstition a rudimentary philosophy.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A miracle, though unexpected, more intelligible than a
regular process.</div>

<p>We sometimes speak as if superstition or belief in the miraculous was
disbelief in law and was inspired by a desire to disorganise experience
and defeat intelligence. No supposition could be more erroneous. Every
superstition is a little science, inspired by the desire to understand,
to foresee, or to control the real world. No doubt its hypothesis is
chimerical, arbitrary, and founded on a confusion of efficient causes
with ideal results. But the same is true of many a renowned philosophy.
To appeal to what we call the supernatural is really to rest in the
imaginatively obvious, in what we ought to call the natural, if natural
meant easy to conceive and originally plausible. Moral and individual
forces are more easily intelligible than mechanical universal laws. The
former domesticate events in the mind more readily and more completely
than the latter. A miracle is so far from being a contradiction to the
causal principle which the mind actually applies in its spontaneous
observations that it is primarily a better illustration of that
principle than an event happening in the ordinary course of nature. For
the ground of the miracle is immediately intelligible; we see the mercy
or the desire to vindicate authority, or the intention of some <a name="Page_23" id="Page_23" />other
sort that inspired it. A mechanical law, on the contrary, is only a
record of the customary but reasonless order of things. A merely
inexplicable event, manifesting no significant purpose, would be no
miracle. What surprises us in the miracle is that, contrary to what is
usually the case, we can see a real and just ground for it. Thus, if the
water of Lourdes, bottled and sold by chemists, cured all diseases,
there would be no miracle, but only a new scientific discovery. In such
a case, we should no more know why we were cured than we now know why we
were created. But if each believer in taking the water thinks the effect
morally conditioned, if he interprets the result, should it be
favourable, as an answer to his faith and prayers, then the cure becomes
miraculous because it becomes intelligible and manifests the obedience
of nature to the exigencies of spirit. Were there no known ground for
such a scientific anomaly, were it a meaningless irregularity in events,
we should not call it a miracle, but an accident, and it would have no
relation to religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superstitions come of haste to understand.</div>

<p>What establishes superstitions is haste to understand, rash confidence
in the moral intelligibility of things. It turns out in the end, as we
have laboriously discovered, that understanding has to be circuitous and
cannot fulfil its function until it applies mechanical categories to
existence. A thorough philosophy will become aware that moral
intelligibility can only be an incidental ornament <a name="Page_24" id="Page_24" />and partial harmony
in the world. For moral significance is relative to particular interests
and to natures having a constitutional and definite bias, and having
consequently special preferences which it is chimerical to expect the
rest of the world to be determined by. The attempt to subsume the
natural order under the moral is like attempts to establish a government
of the parent by the child&mdash;something children are not averse to. But
such follies are the follies of an intelligent and eager creature,
restless in a world it cannot at once master and comprehend. They are
the errors of reason, wanderings in the by-paths of philosophy, not due
to lack of intelligence or of faith in law, but rather to a premature
vivacity in catching at laws, a vivacity misled by inadequate
information. The hunger for facile wisdom is the root of all false
philosophy. The mind's reactions anticipate in such cases its sufficient
nourishment; it has not yet matured under the rays of experience, so
that both materials and guidance are lacking for its precocious
organising force. Superstitious minds are penetrating and narrow, deep
and ignorant. They apply the higher categories before the lower&mdash;an
inversion which in all spheres produces the worst and most pathetic
disorganisation, because the lower functions are then deranged and the
higher contaminated. Poetry anticipates science, on which it ought to
follow, and imagination rushes in to intercept memory, on which it ought
to feed. Hence <a name="Page_25" id="Page_25" />superstition and the magical function of religion; hence
the deceptions men fall into by cogitating on things they are ignorant
of and arrogating to themselves powers which they have never learned to
exercise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inattention suffers them to spread.</div>

<p>It is now generally acknowledged that workers of miracles, prophets,
soothsayers, and inspired or divinely appointed men may, like
metaphysicians, be quite sincere and fully believe they possess the
powers which they pretend to display. In the case of the more
intelligent, however, this sincerity was seldom complete, but mixed with
a certain pitying or scornful accommodation to the vulgar mind.
Something unusual might actually have happened, in which case the
reference of it to the will that welcomed it (without, of course, being
able to command it unconditionally) might well seem reasonable. Or
something normal might have been interpreted fancifully, but to the
greater glory of God and edification of the faithful; in which case the
incidental error might be allowed to pass unchallenged out of respect
for the essential truths thus fortified in pious minds. The power of
habit and convention, by which the most crying inconsistencies and
hypocrisies are soon put to sleep, would facilitate these accommodations
and render them soon instinctive; while the world at large, entirely
hypnotised by the ceremonious event and its imaginative echoes, could
never come to close quarters with <a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" />the facts at all, but could view them
only through accepted preconceptions. Thus elaborate machinery can arise
and long endure for the magical service of man's interests. How deeply
rooted such conventions are, how natural it is that they should have
dominated even civilised society, may best be understood if we consider
the remnants of such habits in our midst&mdash;not among gypsies or
professional wonder-workers but among reflecting men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genius may use them to convey an inarticulate wisdom.</div>

<p>Some men of action, like C&aelig;sar and Napoleon, are said to have been
superstitious about their own destiny. The phenomenon, if true, would be
intelligible. They were masterful men, men who in a remarkable degree
possessed in their consciousness the sign and sanction of what was
happening in the world. This endowment, which made them dominate their
contemporaries, could also reveal the sources and conditions of their
own will. They might easily come to feel that it was destiny&mdash;the total
movement of things&mdash;that inspired, crowned, and ruined them. But as they
could feel this only instinctively, not by a systematic view of all the
forces in play, they would attach their voluminous sense of fatality to
some chance external indication or to some ephemeral impulse within
themselves; so that what was essentially a profound but inarticulate
science might express itself in the guise of a superstition.</p>

<p>In like manner Socrates' Demon (if not actually a playful fable by which
the sage expressed the <a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" />negative stress of conscience, the &quot;thou shalt
not&quot; of all awe-inspiring precepts) might be a symbol for latent wisdom.
Socrates turned a trick, played upon him by his senses, into a message
from heaven. He taught a feeble voice&mdash;senseless like all ghostly
voices&mdash;to sanction precepts dictated by the truly divine element within
himself. It was characteristic of his modest piety to look for some
external sign to support reason; his philosophy was so human, and man is
obviously so small a part of the world, that he could reasonably
subordinate reason at certain junctures. Its abdication, however, was
half playful, for he could always find excellent grounds for what the
demon commanded.</p>

<p>In much the same manner the priests at Delphi, when they were prudent,
made of the Pythia's ravings oracles not without elevation of tone and
with an obvious political tendency. Occasions for superstition which
baser minds would have turned to sheer lunacy or silly fears or
necromantic clap-trap were seized by these nobler natures for a good
purpose. A benevolent man, not inclined to scepticism, can always argue
that the gods must have commanded what he himself knows to be right; and
he thinks it religion on his part to interpret the oracle accordingly,
or even to prompt it. In such ways the most arbitrary superstitions take
a moral colour in a moral mind; something which can come about all the
more easily since the roots of reason and superstition are intertwined
in the mind, and society has always expressed and cultivated them
together.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>MAGIC, SACRIFICE, AND PRAYER</p>


<div class="sidenote">Fear created the gods.</div>

<p>That fear first created the gods is perhaps as true as anything so brief
could be on so great a subject. To recognise an external power it is
requisite that we should find the inner stream and tendency of life
somehow checked or disturbed; if all went well and acceptably, we should
attribute divinity only to ourselves. The external is therefore evil
rather than good to early apprehension&mdash;a sentiment which still survives
in respect to matter; for it takes reflection to conceive that external
forces form a necessary environment, creating as well as limiting us,
and offering us as many opportunities as rebuffs. The first things which
a man learns to distinguish and respect are things with a will of their
own, things which resist his casual demands; and so the first sentiment
with which he confronts reality is a certain animosity, which becomes
cruelty toward the weak and fear and fawning before the powerful. Toward
men and animals and the docile parts of nature these sentiments soon
become defined accurately, representing the exact degree of friendliness
or use which <a name="Page_29" id="Page_29" />we discover in these beings; and it is in practical terms,
expressing this relation to our interests, that we define their
characters. Much remains over, however, which we cannot easily define,
indomitable, ambiguous regions of nature and consciousness which we know
not how to face; yet we cannot ignore them, since it is thence that
comes what is most momentous in our fortunes&mdash;luck, disease, tempest,
death, victory. Thence come also certain mysterious visitations to the
inner mind&mdash;dreams, apparitions, warnings. To perceive these things is
not always easy, nor is it easy to interpret them, while the great
changes in nature which, perhaps, they forebode may indeed be watched
but cannot be met intelligently, much less prevented. The feeling with
which primitive man walks the earth must accordingly be, for the most
part, apprehension; and what he meets, beyond the well-conned ways of
his tribe and habitat, can be nothing but formidable spirits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Need also contributed.</div>

<p>Impotence, however, has a more positive side. If the lightning and
thunder, startling us in our peace, suddenly reveal unwelcome powers
before which we must tremble, hunger, on the contrary, will torment us
with floating ideas, intermittent impulses to act, suggesting things
which would be wholly delightful if only we could find them, but which
it becomes intolerable to remain without. In this case our fear, if we
still choose to call it so, would be lest our cravings should remain
unsatisfied, or rather fear has given <a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" />place to need; we recognise our
dependence on external powers not because they threaten but because they
forsake us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The real evidences of God's existence.</div>

<p>Obvious considerations like these furnish the proof of God's existence,
not as philosophers have tried to express it after the fact and in
relation to mythical conceptions of God already current, but as mankind
originally perceived it, and (where religion is spontaneous) perceives
it still. There is such an order in experience that we find our desires
doubly dependent on something which, because it disregards our will, we
call an external power. Sometimes it overwhelms us with scourges and
wonders, so that we must marvel at it and fear; sometimes it removes, or
after removing restores, a support necessary to our existence and
happiness, so that we must cling to it, hope for it, and love it.
Whatever is serious in religion, whatever is bound up with morality and
fate, is contained in those plain experiences of dependence and of
affinity to that on which we depend. The rest is poetry, or mythical
philosophy, in which definitions not warranted in the end by experience
are given to that power which experience reveals. To reject such
arbitrary definitions is called atheism by those who frame them; but a
man who studies for himself the ominous and the friendly aspects of
reality and gives them the truest and most adequate expression he can is
repeating what the founders of religion did in the beginning. He is
their companion and fol<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31" />lower more truly than are the apologists for
second-hand conceptions which these apologists themselves have never
compared with the facts, and which they prize chiefly for
misrepresenting actual experience and giving it imaginary extensions.</p>

<p>Religion is not essentially an imposture, though it might seem so if we
consider it as its defenders present it to us rather than as its
discoverers and original spokesmen uttered it in the presence of nature
and face to face with unsophisticated men. Religion is an interpretation
of experience, honestly made, and made in view of man's happiness and
its empirical conditions. That this interpretation is poetical goes
without saying, since natural and moral science, even to-day, are
inadequate for the task. But the mythical form into which men cast their
wisdom was not chosen by them because they preferred to be imaginative;
it was not embraced, as its survivals are now defended, out of
sentimental attachment to grandiloquent but inaccurate thoughts.
Mythical forms were adopted because none other were available, nor could
the primitive mind discriminate at all between the mythical and the
scientific. Whether it is the myth or the wisdom it expresses that we
call religion is a matter of words. Certain it is that the wisdom is
alone what gives the myth its dignity, and what originally suggested it.
God's majesty lies in his operation, not in his definition or his image.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Practice precedes theory in religion.</div>

<p>Fear and need, then, bring us into the presence <a name="Page_32" id="Page_32" />of external powers,
conceived mythically, whose essential character is to be now terrible,
now auspicious. The influence is real and directly felt; the gods'
function is unmistakable and momentous, while their name and form, the
fabulous beings to which that felt influence is imputed, vary with the
resources of the worshipper's mind and his poetic habits. The work of
expression, the creation of a fabulous environment to derive experience
from, is not, however, the first or most pressing operation employing
the religious mind. Its first business is rather the work of
propitiation; before we stop to contemplate the deity we hasten to
appease it, to welcome it, or to get out of its way. Cult precedes fable
and helps to frame it, because the feeling of need or fear is a
practical feeling, and the ideas it may awaken are only incidental to
the reactions it prompts. Worship is therefore earlier and nearer to the
roots of religion than dogma is.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pathetic, tentative nature of religious practices.</div>

<p>At the same time, since those reactions which are directly efficacious
go to form arts and industrial habits, and eventually put before us the
world of science and common-sense, religious practice and thought are
confined to the sphere in which direct manipulation of things is
impossible. Cultus is always distinguishable from industry, even when
the worshipper's motives are most sordid and his notions most material;
for in religious operations the <a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" />changes worked or expected can never be
traced consecutively. There is a break, often a complete diversity and
disproportion, between effort and result. Religion is a form of rational
living more empirical, looser, more primitive than art. Man's
consciousness in it is more immersed in nature, nearer to a vegetative
union with the general life; it bemoans division and celebrates harmony
with a more passive and lyrical wonder. The element of action proper to
religion is extremely arbitrary, and we are often at a loss to see in
what way the acts recommended conduce at all to the result foretold.</p>

<p>As theoretical superstition stops at any cause, so practical
superstition seizes on any means. Religion arises under high pressure:
in the last extremity, every one appeals to God. But in the last
extremity all known methods of action have proved futile; when resources
are exhausted and ideas fail, if there is still vitality in the will it
sends a supreme appeal to the supernatural. This appeal is necessarily
made in the dark: it is the appeal of a conscious impotence, of an
avowed perplexity. What a man in such a case may come to do to
propitiate the deity, or to produce by magic a result he cannot produce
by art, will obviously be some random action. He will be driven back to
the place where instinct and reason begin. His movement will be
absolutely experimental, altogether spontaneous. He will have no reason
for what he does, save that he must do something.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34" />Meanness and envy in the gods, suggesting sacrifice.</div>

<p>What he will do, however, will not be very original; a die must fall on
some one of its six faces, shake it as much as you please. When Don
Quixote, seeking to do good absolutely at a venture, let the reins drop
on Rocinante's neck, the poor beast very naturally followed the highway;
and a man wondering what will please heaven can ultimately light on
nothing but what might please himself. It is pathetic to observe how
lowly the motives are that religion, even the highest, attributes to the
deity, and from what a hard-pressed and bitter existence they have been
drawn. To be given the best morsel, to be remembered, to be praised, to
be obeyed blindly and punctiliously&mdash;these have been thought points of
honour with the gods, for which they would dispense favours and
punishments on the most exorbitant scale. Indeed, the widespread
practice of sacrifice, like all mutilations and penances, suggests an
even meaner jealousy and malice in the gods; for the disciplinary
functions which these things may have were not aimed at in the
beginning, and would not have associated them particularly with
religion. In setting aside the fat for the gods' pleasure, in
sacrificing the first-born, in a thousand other cruel ceremonies, the
idea apparently was that an envious onlooker, lurking unseen, might
poison the whole, or revenge himself for not having enjoyed it, unless a
part&mdash;possibly sufficient for his hunger&mdash;were surrendered to him
volun<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" />tarily. This onlooker was a veritable demon, treated as a man
treats a robber to whom he yields his purse that his life may be spared.</p>

<p>To call the gods envious has a certain symbolic truth, in that earthly
fortunes are actually precarious; and such an observation might inspire
detachment from material things and a kind of philosophy. But what at
first inspires sacrifice is a literal envy imputed to the gods, a spirit
of vengeance and petty ill-will; so that they grudge a man even the good
things which they cannot enjoy themselves. If the god is a tyrant, the
votary will be a tax-payer surrendering his tithes to secure immunity
from further levies or from attack by other potentates. God and man will
be natural enemies, living in a sort of politic peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ritualistic arts.</div>

<p>Sacrifices are far from having merely this sinister meaning. Once
inaugurated they suggest further ideas, and from the beginning they had
happier associations. The sacrifice was incidental to a feast, and the
plenty it was to render safe existed already. What was a bribe, offered
in the spirit of barter, to see if the envious power could not be
mollified by something less than the total ruin of his victims, could
easily become a genial distribution of what custom assigned to each: so
much to the chief, so much to the god, so much to the husbandman. There
is a certain openness, and as it were the form of justice, in giving
each what is conventionally his due, however little <a name="Page_36" id="Page_36" />he may really
deserve it. In religious observances this sentiment plays an important
part, and men find satisfaction in fulfilling in a seemly manner what is
prescribed; and since they know little about the ground or meaning of
what they do, they feel content and safe if at least they have done it
properly. Sacrifices are often performed in this spirit; and when a
beautiful order and religious calm have come to dignify the performance,
the mind, having meantime very little to occupy it, may embroider on the
given theme. It is then that fable, and new religious sentiments
suggested by fable, appear prominently on the scene.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thank-offerings.</div>

<p>In agricultural rites, for instance, sacrifice will naturally be offered
to the deity presiding over germination; that is the deity that might,
perhaps, withdraw his favour with disastrous results. He commonly
proves, however, a kindly and responsive being, and in offering to him a
few sheaves of corn, some barley-cakes, or a libation from the vintage,
the public is grateful rather than calculating; the sacrifice has become
an act of thanksgiving. So in Christian devotion (which often follows
primitive impulses and repeats the dialectic of paganism in a more
speculative region) the redemption did not remain merely expiatory. It
was not merely a debt to be paid off and a certain quantum of suffering
to be endured which had induced the Son of God to become man and to take
up his cross. It was, so the subtler theologians declared, an act of
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" />affection as much as of pity; and the spell of the doctrine over the
human heart lay in feeling that God wished to assimilate himself to man,
rather than simply from above to declare him forgiven; so that the
incarnation was in effect a rehabilitation of man, a redemption in
itself, and a forgiveness. Men like to think that God has sat at their
table and walked among them in disguise. The idea is flattering; it
suggests that the courtesy may some day be returned, and for those who
can look so deep it expresses pointedly the philosophic truth of the
matter. For are not the gods, too, in eternal travail after their ideal,
and is not man a part of the world, and his art a portion of the divine
wisdom? If the incarnation was a virtual redemption, the truest
incarnation was the laborious creation itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sacrifice of a contrite heart.</div>

<p>If sacrifice, in its more amiable aspect, can become thanksgiving and an
expression of profitable dependence, it can suffer an even nobler
transformation while retaining all its austerity. Renunciation is the
corner-stone of wisdom, the condition of all genuine achievement. The
gods, in asking for a sacrifice, may invite us to give up not a part of
our food or of our liberty but the foolish and inordinate part of our
wills. The sacrifice may be dictated to us not by a jealous enemy
needing to be pacified but by a far-seeing friend, wishing we may not be
deceived. If what we are commanded to surrender is only what is doing us
harm, the god <a name="Page_38" id="Page_38" />demanding the sacrifice is our own ideal. He has no
interests in the case other than our own; he is no part of the
environment; he is the goal that determines for us how we should proceed
in order to realise as far as possible our inmost aspirations. When
religion reaches this phase it has become thoroughly moral. It has
ceased to represent or misrepresent material conditions, and has learned
to embody spiritual goods.</p>

<p>Sacrifice is a rite, and rites can seldom be made to embody ideas
exclusively moral. Something dramatic or mystical will cling to the
performance, and, even when the effect of it is to purify, it will bring
about an emotional catharsis rather than a moral improvement. The mass
is a ritual sacrifice, and the communion is a part of it, having the
closest resemblance to what sacrifices have always been. Among the
devout these ceremonies, and the lyric emotions they awaken, have a
quite visible influence; but the spell is mystic, the god soon recedes,
and it would be purely fanciful to maintain that any permanent moral
effect comes from such an exercise. The Church has felt as much and
introduced the confession, where a man may really be asked to consider
what sacrifices he should make for his part, and in what practical
direction he should imagine himself to be drawn by the vague Dionysiac
influences to which the ritual subjects him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prayer is not utilitarian in essence.</div>

<p>As sacrifice expresses fear, prayer expresses need. Common-sense thinks
of language as some<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39" />thing meant to be understood by another and to
produce changes in his disposition and behaviour, but language has
pre-rational uses, of which poetry and prayer are perhaps the chief. A
man overcome by passion assumes dramatic attitudes surely not intended
to be watched and interpreted; like tears, gestures may touch an
observer's heart, but they do not come for that purpose. So the fund of
words and phrases latent in the mind flow out under stress of emotion;
they flow because they belong to the situation, because they fill out
and complete a perception absorbing the mind; they do not flow primarily
to be listened to. The instinct to pray is one of the chief avenues to
the deity, and the form prayer takes helps immensely to define the power
it is addressed to; indeed, it is in the act of praying that men
formulate to themselves what God must be, and tell him at great length
what they believe and what they expect of him. The initial forms of
prayer are not so absurd as the somewhat rationalised forms of it.
Unlike sacrifice, prayer seems to be justified by its essence and to be
degraded by the transformations it suffers in reflection, when men try
to find a place for it in their cosmic economy; for its essence is
poetical, expressive, contemplative, and it grows more and more
nonsensical the more people insist on making it a prosaic, commercial
exchange of views between two interlocutors.</p>

<p>Prayer is a soliloquy; but being a soliloquy ex<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40" />pressing need, and being
furthermore, like sacrifice, a desperate expedient which men fly to in
their impotence, it looks for an effect: to cry aloud, to make vows, to
contrast eloquently the given with the ideal situation, is certainly as
likely a way of bringing about a change for the better as it would be to
chastise one's self severely, or to destroy what one loves best, or to
perform acts altogether trivial and arbitrary. Prayer also is magic, and
as such it is expected to do work. The answer looked for, or one which
may be accepted instead, very often ensues; and it is then that
mythology begins to enter in and seeks to explain by what machinery of
divine passions and purposes that answering effect was produced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its supposed efficacy magical.</div>

<p>Magic is in a certain sense the mother of art, art being the magic that
succeeds and can establish itself. For this very reason mere magic is
never appealed to when art has been found, and no unsophisticated man
prays to have that done for him which he knows how to do for himself.
When his art fails, if his necessity still presses, he appeals to magic,
and he prays when he no longer can control the event, provided this
event is momentous to him. Prayer is not a substitute for work; it is a
desperate effort to work further and to be efficient beyond the range of
one's powers. It is not the lazy who are most inclined to prayer; those
pray most who care most, and who, having worked hard, find it
intolerable to be defeated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41" />Theological puzzles.</div>

<p>No chapter in theology is more unhappy than that in which a material
efficacy is assigned to prayer. In the first place the facts contradict
the notion that curses can bring evil or blessings can cure; and it is
not observed that the most orthodox and hard-praying army wins the most
battles. The facts, however, are often against theology, which has to
rely on dialectical refinements to explain them away; but unfortunately
in this instance dialectic is no less hostile than experience. God must
know our necessities before we ask and, if he is good, must already have
decided what he would do for us. Prayer, like every other act, becomes
in a providential world altogether perfunctory and histrionic; we are
compelled to go through it, it is set down for us in the play, but it
lacks altogether that moral value which we assign to it. When our
prayers fail, it must be better than if they had succeeded, so that
prayer, with all free preference whatsoever, becomes an absurdity. The
trouble is much deeper than that which so many people find in
determinism. A physical predetermination, in making all things
necessary, leaves all values entire, and my preferences, though they
cannot be efficacious unless they express preformed natural forces, are
not invalidated ideally. It is still true that the world would have been
better to all eternity if my will also could have been fulfilled. A
providential optimism, on the contrary, not merely predetermines events
but discounts values; and it <a name="Page_42" id="Page_42" />reduces every mortal aspiration, every
pang of conscience; every wish that things should be better than they
are, to a blind impertinence, nay, to a sacrilege. Thus, you may not
pray that God's kingdom may come, but only&mdash;what is not a prayer but a
dogma&mdash;that it has come already. The mythology that pretends to justify
prayer by giving it a material efficacy misunderstands prayer completely
and makes it ridiculous, for it turns away from the heart, which prayer
expresses pathetically, to a fabulous cosmos where aspirations have been
turned into things and have thereby stifled their own voices.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A real efficacy would be mechanical.</div>

<p>The situation would not be improved if we surrendered that mystical
optimism, and maintained that prayer might really attract super-human
forces to our aid by giving them a signal without which they would not
have been able to reach us. If experience lent itself to such a theory
there would be nothing in it more impossible than in ordinary telepathy;
prayer would then be an art like conversation, and the exact personages
and interests would be discoverable to which we might appeal. A
celestial diplomacy might then be established not very unlike primitive
religions. Religion would have reverted to industry and science, to
which the grosser spirits that take refuge under it have always wished
to assimilate it. But is it really the office of religion to work upon
external powers and extract from them certain calculable effects? Is it
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43" />an art, like empiric medicine, and merely a dubious and mystic
industry? If so, it exists only by imperfection; were it better
developed it would coincide with those material and social arts with
which it is identical in essence. Successful religion, like successful
magic, would have passed into the art of exploiting the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">True uses of prayer.</div>

<p>What successful religion really should pass into is contemplation,
ideality, poetry, in the sense in which poetry includes all imaginative
moral life. That this is what religion looks to is very clear in prayer
and in the efficacy which prayer consistently can have. In rational
prayer the soul may be said to accomplish three things important to its
welfare: it withdraws within itself and defines its good, it
accommodates itself to destiny, and it grows like the ideal which it
conceives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It clarifies the ideal.</div>

<p>If prayer springs from need it will naturally dwell on what would
satisfy that necessity; sometimes, indeed, it does nothing else but
articulate and eulogise what is most wanted and prized. This object will
often be particular, and so it should be, since Socrates' prayer &quot;for
the best&quot; would be perfunctory and vapid indeed in a man whose life had
not been spent, like Socrates', in defining what the best was. Yet any
particular good lies in a field of relations; it has associates and
implications, so that the mind dwelling on it and invoking its presence
will naturally be enticed also into its background, and will <a name="Page_44" id="Page_44" />wander
there, perhaps to come upon greater goods, or upon evils which the
coveted good would make inevitable. An earnest consideration, therefore,
of anything desired is apt to enlarge and generalise aspiration till it
embraces an ideal life; for from almost any starting-point the limits
and contours of mortal happiness are soon descried. Prayer, inspired by
a pressing need, already relieves its importunity by merging it in the
general need of the spirit and of mankind. It therefore calms the
passions in expressing them, like all idealisation, and tends to make
the will conformable with reason and justice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It reconciles to the inevitable.</div>

<p>A comprehensive ideal, however, is harder to realise than a particular
one: the rain wished for may fall, the death feared may be averted, but
the kingdom of heaven does not come. It is in the very essence of prayer
to regard a denial as possible. There would be no sense in defining and
begging for the better thing if that better thing had at any rate to be.
The possibility of defeat is one of the circumstances with which
meditation must square the ideal; seeing that my prayer may not be
granted, what in that case should I pray for next? Now the order of
nature is in many respects well known, and it is clear that all
realisable ideals must not transgress certain bounds. The practical
ideal, that which under the circumstances it is best to aim at and pray
for, will not rebel against destiny. Conformity is an element in all
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45" />religion and submission in all prayer; not because what must be is
best, but because the best that may be pursued rationally lies within
the possible, and can be hatched only in the general womb of being. The
prayer, &quot;Thy will be done,&quot; if it is to remain a prayer, must not be
degraded from its original meaning, which was that an unfulfilled ideal
should be fulfilled; it expressed aspiration after the best, not
willingness to be satisfied with, anything. Yet the inevitable must be
accepted, and it is easier to change the human will than the laws of
nature. To wean the mind from extravagant desires and teach it to find
excellence in what life affords, when life is made as worthy as
possible, is a part of wisdom and religion. Prayer, by confronting the
ideal with experience and fate, tends to render that ideal humble,
practical, and efficacious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It fosters spiritual life by conceiving it in its
perfection.</div>

<p>A sense for human limitations, however, has its foil in the ideal of
deity, which is nothing but the ideal of man freed from those
limitations which a humble and wise man accepts for himself, but which a
spiritual man never ceases to feel as limitations. Man, for instance, is
mortal, and his whole animal and social economy is built on that fact,
so that his practical ideal must start on that basis, and make the best
of it; but immortality is essentially better, and the eternal is in many
ways constantly present to a noble mind; the gods therefore are
immortal, and to speak their language in <a name="Page_46" id="Page_46" />prayer is to learn to see all
things as they do and as reason must, under the form of eternity. The
gods are furthermore no respecters of persons; they are just, for it is
man's ideal to be so. Prayer, since it addresses deity, will in the end
blush to be selfish and partial; the majesty of the divine mind
envisaged and consulted will tend to pass into the human mind.</p>

<p>This use of prayer has not been conspicuous in Christian times, because,
instead of assimilating the temporal to the eternal, men have
assimilated the eternal to the temporal, being perturbed fanatics in
religion rather than poets and idealists. Pagan devotion, on the other
hand, was full of this calmer spirit. The gods, being frankly natural,
could be truly ideal. They embodied what was fairest in life and loved
men who resembled them, so that it was delightful and ennobling to see
their images everywhere, and to keep their names and story perpetually
in mind. They did not by their influence alienate man from his
appropriate happiness, but they perfected it by their presence. Peopling
all places, changing their forms as all living things must according to
place and circumstance, they showed how all kinds of being, if perfect
in their kind, might be perfectly good. They asked for a reverence
consistent with reason, and exercised prerogatives that let man free.
Their worship was a perpetual lesson in humanity, moderation, and
beauty. Something pre-rational and monstrous often peeped out behind
their <a name="Page_47" id="Page_47" />serenity, as it does beneath the human soul, and there was
certainly no lack of wildness and mystic horror in their apparitions.
The ideal must needs betray those elemental forces on which, after all,
it rests; but reason exists to exorcise their madness and win them over
to a steady expression of themselves and of the good.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discipline and contemplation are their own reward.</div>


<p>Prayer, in fine, though it accomplishes nothing material, constitutes
something spiritual. It will not bring rain, but until rain comes it may
cultivate hope and resignation and may prepare the heart for any issue,
opening up a vista in which human prosperity will appear in its
conditioned existence and conditional value. A candle wasting itself
before an image will prevent no misfortune, but it may bear witness to
some silent hope or relieve some sorrow by expressing it; it may soften
a little the bitter sense of impotence which would consume a mind aware
of physical dependence but not of spiritual dominion. Worship,
supplication, reliance on the gods, express both these things in an
appropriate parable. Physical impotence is expressed by man's appeal for
help; moral dominion by belief in God's omnipotence. This belief may
afterwards seem to be contradicted by events. It would be so in truth if
God's omnipotence stood for a material magical control of events by the
values they were to generate. But the believer knows in his heart, in
spite of the confused explanations he may give of his feelings, that a
ma<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" />terial efficacy is not the test of his faith. His faith will survive
any outward disappointment. In fact, it will grow by that discipline and
not become truly religious until it ceases to be a foolish expectation
of improbable things and rises on stepping-stones of its material
disappointments into a spiritual peace. What would sacrifice be but a
risky investment if it did not redeem us from the love of those things
which it asks us to surrender? What would be the miserable fruit of an
appeal to God which, after bringing us face to face with him, left us
still immersed in what we could have enjoyed without him? The real use
and excuse for magic is this, that by enticing us, in the service of
natural lusts, into a region above natural instrumentalities, it
accustoms us to that rarer atmosphere, so that we may learn to breathe
it for its own sake. By the time we discover the mechanical futility of
religion we may have begun to blush at the thought of using religion
mechanically; for what should be the end of life if friendship with the
gods is a means only? When thaumaturgy is discredited, the childish
desire to work miracles may itself have passed away. Before we weary of
the attempt to hide and piece out our mortality, our concomitant
immortality may have dawned upon us. While we are waiting for the
command to take up our bed and walk we may hear a voice saying: Thy sins
are forgiven thee.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>MYTHOLOGY</p>


<div class="sidenote">Status of fable in the mind.</div>

<p>Primitive thought has the form of poetry and the function of prose.
Being thought, it distinguishes objects from the experience that reveals
them and it aspires to know things as they are; but being poetical, it
attributes to those objects all the qualities which the experience of
them contains, and builds them out imaginatively in all directions,
without distinguishing what is constant and efficacious in them. This
primitive habit of thought survives in mythology, which is an
observation of things encumbered with all they can suggest to a dramatic
fancy. It is neither conscious poetry nor valid science, but the common
root and raw material of both. Free poetry is a thing which early man is
too poor to indulge in; his wide-open eyes are too intently watching
this ominous and treacherous world. For pure science he has not enough
experience, no adequate power to analyse, remember, and abstract; his
soul is too hurried and confused, too thick with phantoms, to follow
abstemiously the practical threads through the labyrinth. His view of
things is immensely overloaded; what <a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" />he gives out for description is
more than half soliloquy; but his expression of experience is for that
very reason adequate and quite sincere. Belief, which we have come to
associate with religion, belongs really to science; myths are not
believed in, they are conceived and understood. To demand belief for an
idea is already to contrast interpretation with knowledge; it is to
assert that that idea has scientific truth. Mythology cannot flourish in
that dialectical air; it belongs to a deeper and more ingenuous level of
thought, when men pored on the world with intense indiscriminate
interest, accepting and recording the mind's vegetation no less than
that observable in things, and mixing the two developments together in
one wayward drama.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It requires genius.</div>

<p>A good mythology cannot be produced without much culture and
intelligence. Stupidity is not poetical. Nor is mythology essentially a
half-way house between animal vagueness in the soul and scientific
knowledge. It is conceivable that some race, not so dreamful as ours,
should never have been tempted to use psychic and passionate categories
in reading nature, but from the first should have kept its observations
sensuous and pure, elaborating them only on their own plane,
mathematically and dialectically. Such a race, however, could hardly
have had lyric or dramatic genius, and even in natural science, which
requires imagination, they might never have accomplished anything. <a name="Page_51" id="Page_51" />The
Hebrews, denying themselves a rich mythology, remained without science
and plastic art; the Chinese, who seem to have attained legality and
domestic arts and a tutored sentiment without passing through such
imaginative tempests as have harassed us, remain at the same time
without a serious science or philosophy. The Greeks, on the contrary,
precisely the people with the richest and most irresponsible myths,
first conceived the cosmos scientifically, and first wrote rational
history and philosophy. So true it is that vitality in any mental
function is favourable to vitality in the whole mind. Illusions incident
to mythology are not dangerous in the end, because illusion finds in
experience a natural though painful cure. Extravagant error is unstable,
unless it be harmless and confined to a limbo remote from all
applications; if it touches experience it is stimulating and brief,
while the equipoise of dulness may easily render dulness eternal. A
developed mythology shows that man has taken a deep and active interest
both in the world and in himself, and has tried to link the two, and
interpret the one by the other. Myth is therefore a natural prologue to
philosophy, since the love of ideas is the root of both. Both are made
up of things admirable to consider.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It only half deceives.</div>

<p>Nor is the illusion involved in fabulous thinking always so complete and
opaque as convention would represent it. In taking fable for fact, good
sense and practice sel<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52" />dom keep pace with dogma. There is always a race
of pedants whose function it is to materialise everything ideal, but the
great world, half shrewdly, half doggedly, manages to escape their
contagion. Language may be entirely permeated with myth, since the
affinities of language have much to do with men gliding into such
thoughts; yet the difference between language itself and what it
expresses is not so easily obliterated. In spite of verbal traditions,
people seldom take a myth in the same sense in which they would take an
empirical truth. All the doctrines that have flourished in the world
about immortality have hardly affected men's natural sentiment in the
face of death, a sentiment which those doctrines, if taken seriously,
ought wholly to reverse. Men almost universally have acknowledged a
Providence, but that fact has had no force to destroy natural aversions
and fears in the presence of events; and yet, if Providence had ever
been really trusted, those preferences would all have lapsed, being seen
to be blind, rebellious, and blasphemous. Prayer, among sane people, has
never superseded practical efforts to secure the desired end; a proof
that the sphere of expression was never really confused with that of
reality. Indeed, such a confusion, if it had passed from theory to
practice, would have changed mythology into madness. With rare
exceptions this declension has not occurred and myths have been taken
with a grain of salt which not only made them digestible, but heightened
their savour.</p>

<p><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" />It is always by its applicability to things known, not by its
revelation of things unknown and irrelevant, that a myth at its birth
appeals to mankind. When it has lost its symbolic value and sunk to the
level of merely false information, only an inert and stupid tradition
can keep it above water. Parables justify themselves but dogmas call for
an apologist. The genial offspring of prophets and poets then has to be
kept alive artificially by professional doctors. A thing born of fancy,
moulded to express universal experience and its veritable issues, has to
be hedged about by misrepresentation, sophistry, and party spirit. The
very apologies and unintelligent proofs offered in its defence in a way
confess its unreality, since they all strain to paint in more plausible
colours what is felt to be in itself extravagant and incredible.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Its interpretative essence.</div>

<p>Yet if the myth was originally accepted it could not be for this falsity
plainly written on its face; it was accepted because it was understood,
because it was seen to express reality in an eloquent metaphor. Its
function was to show up some phase of experience in its totality and
moral issue, as in a map we reduce everything geographically in order to
overlook it better in its true relations. Had those symbols for a moment
descended to the plane of reality they would have lost their meaning and
dignity; they would tell us merely that they themselves existed bodily,
which would be false, while <a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" />about the real configuration of life they
would no longer tell us anything. Such an error, if carried through to
the end, would nullify all experience and arrest all life. Men would be
reacting on expressions and meeting with nothing to express. They would
all be like word-eating philosophers or children learning the catechism.</p>

<p>The true function of mythical ideas is to present and interpret events
in terms relative to spirit. Things have uses in respect to the will
which are direct and obvious, while the inner machinery of these same
things is intricate and obscure. We therefore conceive things roughly
and superficially by their eventual practical functions and assign to
them, in our game, some counterpart of the interest they affect in us.
This counterpart, to our thinking, constitutes their inward character
and soul. So conceived, soul and character are purely mythical, being
arrived at by dramatising events according to our own fancy and
interest. Such ideas may be adequate in their way if they cover all the
uses we may eventually find in the objects they transcribe for us
dramatically. But the most adequate mythology is mythology still; it
does not, like science, set things before us in the very terms they will
wear when they are gradually revealed to experience. Myth is expression,
it is not prophecy. For this reason myth is something on which the mind
rests; it is an ideal interpretation in which the phenomena are digested
and transmuted into human energy, into imaginative tissue.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" />Contrast with science.</div>

<p>Scientific formulas, on the contrary, cry aloud for retranslation into
perceptual terms; they are like tight-ropes, on which a man may walk but
on which he cannot stand still. These unstable symbols lead, however, to
real facts and define their experimental relations; while the mind
reposing contentedly in a myth needs to have all observation and
experience behind it, for it will not be driven to gather more. The
perfect and stable myth would rest on a complete survey and steady
focussing of all interests really affecting the one from whose point of
view the myth was framed. Then each physical or political unit would be
endowed with a character really corresponding to all its influence on
the thinker. This symbol would render the diffuse natural existences
which it represented in an eloquent figure; and since this figure would
not mislead practically it might be called true. But truth, in a myth,
means a sterling quality and standard excellence, not a literal or
logical truth. It will not, save by a singular accident, represent their
proper internal being, as a forthright unselfish intellect would wish to
know it. It will translate into the language of a private passion the
smiles and frowns which that passion meets with in the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of the moral factor.</div>

<p>There are accordingly two factors in mythology, a moral consciousness
and a corresponding poetic conception of things. Both factors are
variable, and variations in the first, if more hidden, are no less
important <a name="Page_56" id="Page_56" />than variations in the second. Had fable started with a clear
perception of human values, it would have gained immensely in
significance, because its pictures, however wrong the external notions
they built upon, would have shown what, in the world so conceived, would
have been the ideals and prizes of life. Thus Dante's bad cosmography
and worse history do not detract from the spiritual penetration of his
thought, though they detract from its direct applicability. Had nature
and destiny been what Dante imagined, his conception of the values
involved would have been perfect, for the moral philosophy he brought
into play was Aristotelian and rational. So his poem contains a false
instance or imaginary rehearsal of true wisdom. It describes the Life of
Reason in a fantastic world. We need only change man's situation to that
in which he actually finds himself, and let the soul, fathomed and
chastened as Dante left it, ask questions and draw answers from this
steadier dream.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its submergence.</div>

<p>Myth travels among the people, and in their hands its poetic factor
tends to predominate. It is easier to carry on the dialectic or drama
proper to a fable than to confront it again with the facts and give them
a fresh and more genial interpretation. The poet makes the fable; the
sophist carries it on. Therefore historians and theologians discuss
chiefly the various forms which mythical beings have received, and the
internal logical or moral implications of those <a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" />hypostases. They would
do better to attend instead to the moral factor. However interesting a
fable may be in itself, its religious value lies wholly in its revealing
some function which nature has in human life. Not the beauty of the god
makes him adorable, but his dispensing benefits and graces. Side by side
with Apollo (a god having moral functions and consequently inspiring a
fervent cult and tending himself to assume a moral character) there may
be a Helios or a Pha&euml;thon, poetic figures expressing just as well the
sun's physical operation, and no less capable, if the theologian took
hold of them, of suggesting psychological problems. The moral factor,
however, was not found in these minor deities. Only a verbal and
sensuous poetry had been employed in defining them; the needs and hopes
of mankind had been ignored. Apollo, on the contrary, in personifying
the sun, had embodied also the sun's relations to human welfare. The
vitality, the healing, the enlightenment, the lyric joy flowing into
man's heart from that highest source of his physical being are all
beautifully represented in the god's figure and fable. The religion of
Apollo is therefore a true religion, as religions may be true: the
mythology which created the god rested on a deep, observant sense for
moral values, and drew a vivid, if partial, picture of the ideal,
attaching it significantly to its natural ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Myth justifies magic.</div>

<p>The first function of mythology is to justify magic. The weak hope on
which superstition <a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" />hangs, the gambler's instinct which divines in
phenomena a magic solicitude for human fortunes, can scarcely be
articulated without seeking to cover and justify itself by some fable. A
magic function is most readily conceived and defined by attributing to
the object intentions hostile or favourable to men, together with human
habits of passion and discourse. For lack of resources and observations,
reason is seldom able to discredit magic altogether. Reasonable men are
forced, therefore, in order to find some satisfaction, to make magic as
intelligible as possible by assimilating it to such laws of human action
as may be already mastered and familiar. Magic is thus reduced to a sort
of system, regulated by principles of its own and naturalised, as it
were, in the commonwealth of science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Myths might be metaphysical.</div>

<p>Such an avowed and defended magic usually takes one of two forms. When
the miracle is interpreted dramatically, by analogy to human life, we
have mythology; when it is interpreted rationalistically, by analogy to
current logic or natural science, we have metaphysics or theosophy. The
metaphysical sort of superstition has never taken deep root in the
western world. Pythagorean mysteries and hypnotisations, although
periodically fashionable, have soon shrivelled in our too salubrious and
biting air. Even such charming exotics as Plato's myths have not been
able to flourish without changing their nature and passing into ordinary
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59" />dramatic mythology&mdash;into a magic system in which all the forces, once
terms in moral experience, became personal angels and demons. Similarly
with the Christian sacraments: these magic rites, had they been
established in India among a people theosophically minded, might have
furnished cues to high transcendental mysteries. Baptism might have been
interpreted as a symbol for the purged and abolished will, and Communion
as a symbol for the escape from personality. But European races, though
credulous enough, are naturally positivistic, so that, when they were
called upon to elucidate their ceremonial mysteries, what they lit upon
was no metaphysical symbolism but a material and historical drama.
Communion became a sentimental interview between the devout soul and the
person of Christ; baptism became the legal execution of a mythical
contract once entered into between the first and second persons of the
Trinity. Thus, instead of a metaphysical interpretation, the extant
magic received its needful justification through myths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They appear ready made, like parts of the social fabric.</div>

<p>When mythology first appears in western literature it already possesses
a highly articulate form. The gods are distinct personalities, with
attributes and histories which it is hard to divine the source of and
which suggest no obvious rational interpretation. The historian is
therefore in the same position as a child who inherits a great religion.
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60" />The gods and their doings are <i>prima facie</i> facts in his world like any
other facts, objective beings that convention puts him in the presence
of and with which he begins by having social relations. He envisages
them with respect and obedience, or with careless defiance, long before
he thinks of questioning or proving their existence. The attitude he
assumes towards them makes them in the first instance factors in his
moral world. Much subsequent scepticism and rationalising philosophy
will not avail to efface the vestiges of that early communion with
familiar gods. It is hard to reduce to objects of science what are
essentially factors in moral intercourse. All thoughts on religion
remain accordingly coloured with passion, and are felt to be, above all,
a test of loyalty and an index to virtue. The more derivative,
unfathomable, and opaque is the prevalent idea of the gods, the harder
it is for a rational feeling to establish itself in their regard.
Sometimes the most complete historical enlightenment will not suffice to
dispel the shadow which their moral externality casts over the mind. In
vain do we discard their fable and the thin proofs of their existence
when, in spite of ourselves, we still live in their presence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They perplex the conscience.</div>

<p>This pathetic phenomenon is characteristic of religious minds that have
outgrown their traditional faith without being able to restate the
natural grounds and moral values of that somehow precious system in
which they no longer believe. The dead <a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" />gods, in such cases, leave
ghosts behind them, because the moral forces which the gods once
expressed, and which, of course, remain, remain inarticulate; and
therefore, in their dumbness, these moral forces persistently suggest
their only known but now discredited symbols. To regain moral
freedom&mdash;without which knowledge cannot be put to its rational use in
the government of life&mdash;we must rediscover the origin of the gods,
reduce them analytically to their natural and moral constituents, and
then proceed to rearrange those materials, without any quantitative
loss, in forms appropriate to a maturer reflection.</p>

<p>Of the innumerable and rather monotonous mythologies that have
flourished in the world, only the Gr&aelig;co-Roman and the Christian need
concern us here, since they are by far the best known to us and the best
defined in themselves, as well as the only two likely to have any
continued influence on the western mind. Both these systems pre-suppose
a long prior development. The gods of Greece and of Israel have a
full-blown character when we first meet them in literature. In both
cases, however, we are fortunate in being able to trace somewhat further
back the history of mythology, and do not depend merely on philosophic
analysis to reach the elements which we seek.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incipient myth in the Vedas.</div>

<p>In the Vedic hymns there survives the record of a religion remarkably
like the Greek in spirit, <a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" />but less dramatic and articulate in form. The
gods of the Vedas are unmistakably natural elements. Vulcan is there
nothing but fire, Jupiter nothing but the sky. This patriarchal people,
fresh from the highlands, had not yet been infected with the manias and
diseases of the jungle. It lived simply, rationally, piously, loving all
natural joys and delighted with all the instruments of a rude but pure
civilisation. It saluted without servility the forces of nature which
ministered to its needs. It burst into song in the presence of the
magnificent panorama spread out before it&mdash;day-sky and night-sky, dawn
and gloaming, clouds, thunder and rain, rivers, cattle and horses,
grain, fruit, fire, and wine. Nor were the social sanctities neglected.
Commemoration was made of the stages of mortal life, of the bonds of
love and kinship, of peace, of battle, and of mourning for the dead. By
a very intelligible figure and analogy the winds became shepherds, the
clouds flocks, the day a conqueror, the dawn a maid, the night a wise
sibyl and mysterious consort of heaven. These personifications were
tentative and vague, and the consequent mythology was a system of
rhetoric rather than of theology. The various gods had interchangeable
attributes, and, by a voluntary confusion, quite in the manner of later
Hindu poetry, each became on occasion any or all of the others.</p>

<p>Here the Indian pantheistic vertigo begins to appear. Many dark
superstitions, no doubt, bub<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63" />bled up in the torrent of that plastic
reverie; for this people, clean and natural as on the whole it appears,
cannot have been without a long and ignoble ancestry. The Greeks
themselves, heirs to kindred general traditions, retained some childish
and obscene practices in their worship. But such hobgoblins naturally
vanish under a clear and beneficent sun and are scattered by healthy
mountain breezes. A cheerful people knows how to take them lightly, play
with them, laugh at them, and turn them again into figures of speech.
Among the early speakers of Sanskrit, even more than among the Greeks,
the national religion seems to have been nothing but a poetic
naturalism.</p>

<p>Such a mythology, however, is exceedingly plastic and unstable. If the
poet is observant and renews his impressions, his myths will become more
and more accurate descriptions of the facts, and his hypotheses about
phenomena will tend to be expressed more and more in terms of the
phenomena themselves; that is, will tend to become scientific. If, on
the contrary and as usually happens, the inner suggestions and fertility
of his fables absorb his interest, and he neglects to consult his
external perceptions any further, or even forgets that any such
perceptions originally inspired the myth, he will tend to become a
dramatic poet, guided henceforth in his fictions only by his knowledge
and love of human life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural suggestions soon exhausted.</div>

<div class="sidenote">They will be carried out in abstract fancy.</div>

<p>When we transport ourselves in fancy to patriarchal epochs and Arcadian
scenes, we can well <a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" />feel the inevitable tendency of the mind to
mythologise and give its myths a more and more dramatic character. The
phenomena of nature, unintelligible rationally but immensely impressive,
must somehow be described and digested. But while they compel attention
they do not, after a while, enlarge experience. Husbandmen's lore is
profound, practical, poetic, superstitious, but it is singularly
stagnant. The cycle of natural changes goes its perpetual round and the
ploughman's mind, caught in that narrow vortex, plods and plods after
the seasons. Apart from an occasional flood, drought, or pestilence,
nothing breaks his laborious torpor. The most cursory inspection of
field and sky yields him information enough for his needs. Practical
knowledge with him is all instinct and tradition. His mythology can for
that very reason ride on nature with a looser rein. If at the same time,
however, his circumstances are auspicious and he feels practically
secure, he will have much leisure to ripen inwardly and to think. He
hasten to unfold in meditation the abstract potentialities of his mind.
His social and ideal passions, his aptitude for art and fancy, will
arouse within him a far keener and more varied experience than his outer
life can supply. Yet all his fortunes continue to be determined by
external circumstances and to have for their theatre this given and
uncontrollable world. Some conception of nature and the gods&mdash;<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65" />that is,
in his case, some mythology&mdash;must therefore remain before him always and
stand in his mind for the real forces controlling experience.</p>

<p>His moral powers and interests have meantime notably developed. His
sense for social relations has grown clear and full in proportion as his
observation of nature has sunk into dull routine. Consequently, the
myths by which reality is represented lose, so to speak, their
birthright and first nationality. They pass under the empire of abstract
cogitation and spontaneous fancy. They become naturalised in the mind.
The poet cuts loose from nature and works out instead whatever hints of
human character or romantic story the myth already supplies. Analogies
drawn from moral and passionate experience replace the further
portraiture of outer facts. Human tastes, habits, and dreams enter the
fable, expanding it into some little drama, or some mystic anagram of
mortal life. While in the beginning the sacred poet had transcribed
nothing but joyous perceptions and familiar industrial or martial
actions, he now introduces intrigue, ingenious adventures, and heroic
passions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They may become moral ideals.</div>

<p>When we turn from the theology of the Vedas to that of Homer we see this
revolution already accomplished. The new significance of mythology has
obscured the old, and was a symbol for material facts has become a
drama, an apologue, and an ideal. <a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" />Thus one function of mythology has
been nothing less than to carry religion over from superstition into
wisdom, from an excuse and apology for magic into an ideal
representation of moral goods. In his impotence and sore need a man
appeals to magic; this appeal he justifies by imagining a purpose and a
god behind the natural agency. But after his accounts with the phenomena
are settled by his own labour and patience, he continues to be
fascinated by the invisible spirit he has evoked. He cherishes this
image; it becomes his companion, his plastic and unaccountable witness
and refuge in all the exigencies of life. Dwelling in the mind
continually, the deity becomes acclimated there; the worship it receives
endows it with whatever powers and ideal faculties are most feared or
honoured by its votary. Now the thunder and the pestilence which were
once its essence come to be regarded as its disguises and its foils.
Faith comes to consist in disregarding what it was once religion to
regard, namely, the ways of fortune and the conditions of earthly
happiness. Thus the imagination sets up its ideals over against the
world that occasioned them, and mythology, instead of cheating men with
false and magic aids to action, moralises them by presenting an ideal
standard for action and a perfect object for contemplation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sun-god moralised.</div>

<p>If we consider again, for instance, Apollo's various attributes and the
endless myths connected with his name, we shall find him changing his
essence and forgetting to be the <a name="Page_67" id="Page_67" />material sun in order to become the
light of a cultivated spirit. At first he is the sky's child, and has
the moon for twin sister. His mother is an impersonation of darkness and
mystery. He travels yearly from the hyperborean regions toward the
south, and daily he traverses the firmament in a chariot. He sleeps in a
sea-nymph's bosom or rises from the dawn's couch. In all this we see
clearly a scarcely figurative description of the material sun and its
motions. A quasi-scientific fancy spins these fables almost inevitably
to fill the vacuum not yet occupied by astronomy. Such myths are indeed
compacted out of wonders, not indeed to add wonder to them (for the
original and greatest marvel persists always in the sky), but to
entertain us with pleasant consideration of them and with their
assimilation to our own fine feats. This assimilation is unavoidable in
a poet ignorant of physics, whom human life must supply with all his
vocabulary and similes. Fortunately in this need of introducing romance
into phenomena lies the leaven that is to leaven the lump, the subtle
influence that is to moralise religion. For presently Apollo becomes a
slayer of monsters (a function no god can perform until he has ceased to
be a monster himself), he becomes the lovely and valorous champion of
humanity, the giver of prophecy, of music, of lyric song, even the
patron of medicine and gymnastics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The leaven of religion is moral idealism.</div>

<p>What a humane and rational transformation! The spirit of Socrates was
older than the man and <a name="Page_68" id="Page_68" />had long been at work in the Greeks. Interest
had been transferred from nature to art, from the sources to the fruits
of life. We in these days are accustomed as a matter of course to
associate religion with ideal interests. Our piety, unlike our barbarous
pantheistic theology, has long lost sight of its rudimentary material
object, and habituated us to the worship of human sanctity and human
love. We have need all the more to remember how slowly and reluctantly
religion has suffered spiritualisation, how imperfectly as yet its
superstitious origin has been outgrown. We have need to retrace with the
greatest attention the steps by which a moral value has been insinuated
into what would otherwise be nothing but a medley of magic rites and
poetic physics. It is this submerged idealism which alone, in an age
that should have finally learned how to operate in nature and how to
conceive her processes, could still win for religion a philosopher's
attention or a legislator's mercy.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>THE HEBRAIC TRADITION</p>


<div class="sidenote">Phases of Hebraism.</div>

<p>As the Vedas offer a glimpse into the antecedents of Greek mythology, so
Hebrew studies open up vistas into the antecedents of Christian dogma.
Christianity in its Patristic form was an adaptation of Hebrew religion
to the Gr&aelig;co-Roman world, and later, in the Protestant movement, a
readaptation of the same to what we may call the Teutonic spirit. In the
first adaptation, Hebrew positivism was wonderfully refined, transformed
into a religion of redemption, and endowed with a semi-pagan mythology,
a pseudo-Platonic metaphysics, and a quasi-Roman organisation. In the
second adaptation, Christianity received a new basis and standard in the
spontaneous faith of the individual; and, as the traditions thus
undermined in principle gradually dropped away, it was reduced by the
German theologians to a romantic and mystical pantheism. Throughout its
transformations, however, Christianity remains indebted to the Jews not
only for its founder, but for the nucleus of its dogma, cult, and
ethical doctrine. If the religion of the Jews, therefore, should
disclose its origin, the origin of Christianity would also be manifest.</p>

<p><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70" />Now the Bible, when critically studied, clearly reveals the source, if
not of the earliest religion of Israel, at least of those elements in
later Jewish faith which have descended to us and formed the kernel of
Christian revelation. The earlier Hebrews, as their own records depict
them, had a mythology and cultus extremely like that of other Semitic
peoples. It was natural religion&mdash;I mean that religion which naturally
expresses the imaginative life of a nation according to the conceptions
there current about the natural world and to the interest then uppermost
in men's hearts. It was a religion without a creed or scripture or
founder or clergy. It consisted in local rites, in lunar feasts, in
soothsayings and oracles, in legends about divine apparitions
commemorated in the spots they had made holy. These spots, as in all the
rest of the world, were tombs, wells, great trees, and, above all, the
tops of mountains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Israel's tribal monotheism.</div>

<p>A wandering tribe, at once oppressed and aggressive, as Israel evidently
was from the beginning is conscious of nothing so much as of its tribal
unity. To protect the tribe is accordingly the chief function of its
god. Whatever character Jehovah may originally have had, whether a
storm-god of Sinai or of Ararat, or a sacred bull, or each of these by
affinity and confusion with the other, when the Israelites had once
adopted him as their god they could see nothing essential in him but his
power to protect them in the lands they had conquered. <a name="Page_71" id="Page_71" />To this
exclusive devotion of Jehovah to Israel, Israel responded by a devotion
to Jehovah no less exclusive. They neglected, when at home, the worship
of every other divinity, and later even while travelling abroad; and
they tended to deny altogether, first the comparable power and finally
even the existence of other gods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Problems involved.</div>

<p>Israel was a small people overshadowed by great empires, and its
political situation was always highly precarious. After a brief period
of comparative vigour under David and Solomon (a period afterward
idealised with that oriental imagination which, creating so few glories,
dreams of so many) they declined visibly toward an inevitable absorption
by their neighbours. But, according to the significance which religion
then had in Israel, the ruin of the state would have put Jehovah's
honour and power in jeopardy. The nation and its god were like body and
soul; it occurred to no one as yet to imagine that the one could survive
the other. A few sceptical and unpatriotic minds, despairing of the
republic, might turn to the worship of Baal or of the stars invoked by
the Assyrians, hoping thus to save themselves and their private fortunes
by a timely change of allegiance. But the true Jew had a vehement and
unshakable spirit. He could not allow the waywardness of events to upset
his convictions or the cherished habits of his soul. Accordingly he
bethought himself of a new way of explaining and meeting the imminent
catastrophe.</p>

<p><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72" />The prophets, for to them the revolution in question was due, conceived
that the cause of Israel's misfortunes might be not Jehovah's weakness
but his wrath&mdash;a wrath kindled against the immorality, lukewarmness, and
infidelity of the people. Repentance and a change of life, together with
a purification of the cultus, would bring back prosperity. It was too
late, perhaps, to rescue the whole state. But a remnant might be saved
like a brand from the burning, to be the nucleus of a great restoration,
the seed of a mighty people that should live for ever in godliness and
plenty. Jehovah's power would thus be vindicated, even if Israel were
ruined; nay, his power would be magnified beyond anything formerly
conceived, since now the great powers of Asia would be represented as
his instruments in the chastisement of his people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The prophets put new wine in old bottles.</div>

<p>These views, if we regarded them from the standpoint common in theology
as attempts to re-express the primitive faith, would have to be
condemned as absolutely heretical and spurious. But the prophets were
not interpreting documents or traditions; they were publishing their own
political experience. They were themselves inspired. They saw the
identity of virtue and happiness, the dependence of success upon
conduct. This new truth they announced in traditional language by saying
that Jehovah's favour was to be won only by righteousness and that vice
and folly alienated his good<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73" />will. Their moral insight was genuine; yet
by virtue of the mythical expression they could not well avoid and in
respect to the old orthodoxy, their doctrine was a subterfuge, the first
of those after-thoughts and ingenious reinterpretations by which faith
is continually forced to cover up its initial blunders. For the Jews had
believed that with such a God they were safe in any case; but now they
were told that, to retain his protection, they must practice just those
virtues by which the heathen also might have been made prosperous and
great. It was a true doctrine, and highly salutary, but we need not
wonder that before being venerated the prophets were stoned.</p>

<p>The ideal of this new prophetic religion was still wholly material and
political. The virtues, emphasised and made the chief mark of a
religious life, were recommended merely as magic means to propitiate the
deity, and consequently to insure public prosperity. The thought that
virtue is a natural excellence, the ideal expression of human life,
could not be expected to impress those vehement barbarians any more than
it has impressed their myriad descendants and disciples, Jewish,
Christian, or Moslem. Yet superstitious as the new faith still remained,
and magical as was the efficacy it attributed to virtue, the fact that
virtue rather than burnt offerings was now endowed with miraculous
influence and declared to win the favour of heaven, proved two things
most creditable to the prophets: in the first place, they themselves
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" />loved virtue, else they would hardly have imagined that Jehovah loved
it, or have believed it to be the only path to happiness; and in the
second place, they saw that public events depend on men's character and
conduct, not on omens, sacrifices, or intercessions. There was
accordingly a sense for both moral and political philosophy in these
inspired orators. By assigning a magic value to morality they gave a
moral value to religion. The immediate aim of this morality&mdash;to
propitiate Jehovah&mdash;was indeed imaginary, and its ultimate aim&mdash;to
restore the kingdom of Israel&mdash;was worldly; yet that imaginary aim
covered, in the form of a myth, a sincere consecration to the ideal,
while the worldly purpose led to an almost scientific conception of the
principles and movement of earthly things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inspiration and authority.</div>

<p>To this transformation in the spirit of the law, another almost as
important corresponded in the letter. Scripture was codified,
proclaimed, and given out formally to be inspired by Jehovah and written
by Moses. That all traditions, legends, and rites were inspired and
sacred was a matter of course in antiquity. Nature was full of gods, and
the mind, with its unaccountable dreams and powers, could not be without
them. Its inventions could not be less oracular than the thunder or the
flight of birds. Israel, like every other nation, thought its traditions
divine. These traditions, however, had always been living and elastic;
the prophets them<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" />selves gave proof that inspiration was still a vital
and human thing. It is all the more remarkable, therefore, that while
the prophets were preparing their campaign, under pressure of the same
threatened annihilation, the same puritanical party should have edited a
new code of laws and attributed it retroactively to Moses. While the
prophet's lips were being touched by the coal of fire, the priests and
king in their conclave were establishing the Bible and the Church. It is
easy to suspect, from the accounts we have, that a pious fraud was
perpetrated on this occasion; but perhaps the finding of a forgotten
book of the Law and its proclamation by Josiah, after consulting a
certain prophetess, were not so remote in essence from prophetic
sincerity. In an age when every prophet, seeing what was needful
politically, could cry, &quot;So saith the Lord,&quot; it could hardly be
illegitimate for the priests, seeing what was expedient legally, to
declare, &quot;So said Moses.&quot; Conscience, in a primitive and impetuous
people, may express itself in an apocryphal manner which in a critical
age conscience would altogether exclude. It would have been hardly
conceivable that what was obviously right and necessary should not be
the will of Jehovah, manifested of old to the fathers in the desert and
now again whispered in their children's hearts. To contrive a stricter
observance was an act at once of experimental prudence&mdash;a means of
making destiny, perhaps, less unfavourable&mdash;and an act of more fervent
worship&mdash;a re<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76" />newal of faith in Jehovah, to whose hands the nation was
intrusted more solemnly and irrevocably than ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beginnings of the Church.</div>

<p>This pious experiment failed most signally. Jerusalem was taken, the
Temple destroyed, and the flower of the people carried into exile. The
effect of failure, however, was not to discredit the Law and the
Covenant, now once for all adopted by the unshakable Jews. On the
contrary, when they returned from exile they re-established the
theocracy with greater rigour than ever, adding all the minute
observances, ritualistic and social, enshrined in Leviticus. Israel
became an ecclesiastical community. The Temple, half fortress, half
sanctuary, resounded with perpetual psalms. Piety was fed on a sense at
once of consecration and of guidance. All was prescribed, and to fulfil
the Law, precisely because it involved so complete and, as the world
might say, so arbitrary a regimen, became a precious sacrifice, a
continual act of religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bigotry turned into a principle.</div>

<p>Dogmas are at their best when nobody denies them, for then their
falsehood sleeps, like that of an unconscious metaphor, and their moral
function is discharged instinctively. They count and are not defined,
and the side of them that is not deceptive is the one that comes
forward. What was condemnable in the Jews was not that they asserted the
divinity of their law, for that they did with substantial sincerity and
truth. Their crime is to have <a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" />denied the equal prerogative of other
nations' laws and deities, for this they did, not from critical insight
or intellectual scruples, but out of pure bigotry, conceit, and
stupidity. They did not want other nations also to have a god. The moral
government of the world, which the Jews are praised for having first
asserted, did not mean for them that nature shows a generic benevolence
toward life and reason wherever these arise. Such a moral government
might have been conceived by a pagan philosopher and was not taught in
Israel until, selfishness having been outgrown, the birds and the
heathen were also placed under divine protection. What the moral
government of things meant when it was first asserted was that Jehovah
expressly directed the destinies of heathen nations and the course of
nature itself for the final glorification of the Jews.</p>

<p>No civilised people had ever had such pretensions before. They all
recognised one another's religions, if not as literally true (for some
familiarity is needed to foster that illusion), certainly as more or
less sacred and significant. Had the Jews not rendered themselves odious
to mankind by this arrogance, and taught Christians and Moslems the same
fanaticism, the nature of religion would not have been falsified among
us and we should not now have so much to apologise for and to retract.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Penance accepted.</div>

<p>Israel's calamities, of which the prophets saw only the beginning,
worked a notable spiritualisa<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78" />tion in its religion. The happy thought of
attributing misfortune to wickedness remained a permanent element in the
creed; but as no scrupulous administration of rites, no puritanism, no
good conscience, could avail to improve the political situation, it
became needful for the faithful to reconsider their idea of happiness.
Since holiness must win divine favour, and Israel was undoubtedly holy,
the marks of divine favour must be looked for in Israel's history. To
have been brought in legendary antiquity out of Egypt was something; to
have been delivered from captivity in Babylon was more; yet these signs
of favour could not suffice unless they were at the same time emblems of
hope. But Jewish life had meantime passed into a new phase: it had
become pietistic, priestly, almost ascetic. Such is the might of
suffering, that a race whose nature and traditions were alike
positivistic could for the time being find it sweet to wash its hands
among the innocent, to love the beauty of the Lord's house, and to
praise him for ever and ever. It was agreed and settled beyond cavil
that God loved his people and continually blessed them, and yet in the
world of men tribulation after tribulation did not cease to fall upon
them. There was no issue but to assert (what so chastened a spirit could
now understand) that tribulation endured for the Lord was itself
blessedness, and the sign of some mystical election. Whom the Lord
loveth he chasteneth; so the chosen children of God were, without
paradox, to <a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" />be looked for among the most unfortunate of earth's
children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christianity combines optimism and asceticism.</div>

<p>The prophets and psalmists had already shown some beginnings of this
asceticism or inverted worldliness. The Essenes and the early Christians
made an explicit reversal of ancient Jewish conceptions on this point
the corner-stone of their morality. True, the old positivism remained in
the background. Tribulation was to be short-lived. Very soon the kingdom
of God would be established and a dramatic exchange of places would
ensue between the proud and the humble. The mighty would be hurled from
their seat, the lowly filled with good things. Yet insensibly the
conception of a kingdom of God, of a theocracy, receded or became
spiritualised. The joys of it were finally conceived as immaterial
altogether, contemplative, and reserved for a life after death. Although
the official and literal creed still spoke of a day of judgment, a
resurrection of the body, and a New Jerusalem, these things were
instinctively taken by Christian piety in a more or less symbolic sense.
A longing for gross spectacular greatness, prolonged life, and many
children, after the good old Hebraic fashion, had really nothing to do
with the Christian notion of salvation. Salvation consisted rather in
having surrendered all desire for such things, and all expectation of
happiness to be derived from them. Thus the prophet's doctrine that not
prosperity absolutely and unconditionally, but prosperity <a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" />merited by
virtue, was the portion of God's people changed by insensible gradations
to an ascetic belief that prosperity was altogether alien to virtue and
that a believer's true happiness would be such as Saint Francis paints
it: upon some blustering winter's night, after a long journey, to have
the convent door shut in one's face with many muttered threats and
curses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reason smothered between the two.</div>

<p>In the history of Jewish and Christian ethics the pendulum has swung
between irrational extremes, without ever stopping at that point of
equilibrium at which alone rest is possible. Yet this point was
sometimes traversed and included in the gyrations of our tormented
ancestral conscience. It was passed, for example, at the moment when the
prophets saw that it was human interest that governed right and wrong
and conduct that created destiny. But the mythical form in which this
novel principle naturally presented itself to the prophets' minds, and
the mixture of superstition and national bigotry which remained in their
philosophy, contaminated its truth and were more prolific and contagious
than its rational elements. Hence the incapacity of so much subsequent
thinking to reach clear ideas, and the failure of Christianity, with its
prolonged discipline and opportunities, to establish a serious moral
education. The perpetual painful readjustments of the last twenty
centuries have been adjustments to false facts and imaginary laws; so
that neither could a worthy conception of pros<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81" />perity and of the good be
substituted for heathen and Hebrew crudities on that subject, nor could
the natural goals of human endeavour come to be recognised and
formulated, but all was left to blind impulse or chance tradition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion made an institution.</div>

<p>These defeats of reason are not to be wondered at, if we may indeed
speak of the defeat of what never has led an army. The primitive
naturalism of the Hebrews was not yet superseded by prophetic doctrines
when a new form of materialism arose to stifle and denaturalise what was
rational in those doctrines. Even before hope of earthly empire to be
secured by Jehovah's favour had quite vanished, claims had arisen to
supernatural knowledge founded on revelation. Mythology took a wholly
new shape and alliance with God acquired a new meaning and implication.
For mythology grew, so to speak, double; moral or naturalistic myths
were now reinforced by others of a historical character, to the effect
that the former myths had been revealed supernaturally. At the same time
the sign of divine protection and favour ceased to be primarily
political. Religion now chiefly boasted to possess the Truth, and with
the Truth to possess the secret of a perfectly metaphysical and
posthumous happiness. Revelation, enigmatically contained in Scripture,
found its necessary explication in theology, while the priests, now
guardians of the keys of heaven, naturally enlarged their authority over
the earth. In fine, the poetic legends and patri<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82" />archal worship that had
formerly made up the religion of Israel were transformed into two
concrete and formidable engines&mdash;the Bible and the Church.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>THE CHRISTIAN EPIC</p>


<div class="sidenote">The essence of the good not adventitious but expressive.</div>

<p>Revolutions are ambiguous things. Their success is generally
proportionate to their power of adaptation and to the reabsorption
within them of what they rebelled against. A thousand reforms have left
the world as corrupt as ever, for each successful reform has founded a
new institution, and this institution has bred its new and congenial
abuses. What is capable of truly purifying the world is not the mere
agitation of its elements, but their organisation into a natural body
that shall exude what redounds and absorb or generate what is lacking to
the perfect expression of its soul.</p>

<p>Whence fetch this seminal force and creative ideal? It must evidently
lie already in the matter it is to organise; otherwise it would have no
affinity to that matter, no power over it, and no ideality or value in
respect to the existences whose standard and goal it was to be. There
can be no goods antecedent to the natures they benefit, no ideals prior
to the wills they define. A revolution must find its strength and
legitimacy not in the re<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84" />former's conscience and dream but in the temper
of that society which he would transform; for no transformation is
either permanent or desirable which does not forward the spontaneous
life of the world, advancing those issues toward which it is already
inwardly directed. How should a gospel bring glad tidings, save by
announcing what was from the beginning native to the heart?</p>

<div class="sidenote">A universal religion must interpret the whole world.</div>

<p>No judgment could well be shallower, therefore, than that which condemns
a great religion for not being faithful to that local and partial
impulse which may first have launched it into the world. A great
religion has something better to consider: the conscience and
imagination of those it ministers to. The prophet who announced it first
was a prophet only because he had a keener sense and clearer premonition
than other men of their common necessities; and he loses his function
and is a prophet no longer when the public need begins to outrun his
intuitions. Could Hebraism spread over the Roman Empire and take the
name of Christianity without adding anything to its native inspiration?
Is it to be lamented that we are not all Jews? Yet what makes the
difference is not the teaching of Jesus&mdash;which is pure Hebraism reduced
to its spiritual essence&mdash;but the worship of Christ&mdash;something perfectly
Greek. Christianity would have remained a Jewish sect had it not been
made at once speculative, universal, and ideal by the infusion of Greek
thought, and at the same time plastic and <a name="Page_85" id="Page_85" />devotional by the adoption of
pagan habits. The incarnation of God in man, and the divinisation of man
in God are pagan conceptions, expressions of pagan religious sentiment
and philosophy. Yet what would Christianity be without them? It would
have lost not only its theology, which might be spared, but its
spiritual aspiration, its artistic affinities, and the secret of its
metaphysical charity and joy. It would have remained unconscious, as the
Gospel is, that the hand or the mind of man can ever construct anything.
Among the Jews there were no liberal interests for the ideal to express.
They had only elementary human experience&mdash;the perpetual Oriental round
of piety and servitude in the bosom of a scorched, exhausted country. A
disillusioned eye, surveying such a world, could find nothing there to
detain it; religion, when wholly spiritual, could do nothing but succour
the afflicted, understand and forgive the sinful, and pass through the
sad pageant of life unspotted and resigned. Its pity for human ills
would go hand in hand with a mystic plebeian insensibility to natural
excellence. It would breathe what Tacitus, thinking of the liberal life,
could call <i>odium generis humani</i>; it would be inimical to human genius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Double appeal of Christianity.</div>

<p>There were, we may say, two things in Apostolic teaching which rendered
it capable of converting the world. One was the later Jewish morality
and mysticism, beautifully expressed in Christ's parables and max<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86" />ims,
and illustrated by his miracles, those cures and absolutions which he
was ready to dispense, whatever their sins, to such as called upon his
name. This democratic and untrammelled charity could powerfully appeal
to an age disenchanted with the world, and especially to those lower
classes which pagan polity had covered with scorn and condemned to
hopeless misery. The other point of contact which early Christianity had
with the public need was the theme it offered to contemplation, the
philosophy of history which it introduced into the western world, and
the delicious unfathomable mysteries into which it launched the fancy.
Here, too, the figure of Christ was the centre for all eyes. Its
lowliness, its simplicity, its humanity were indeed, for a while,
obstacles to its acceptance; they did not really lend themselves to the
metaphysical interpretation which was required. Yet even Greek fable was
not without its Apollo tending flocks and its Demeter mourning for her
lost child and serving in meek disguise the child of another. Feeling
was ripe for a mythology loaded with pathos. The humble life, the
homilies, the sufferings of Jesus could be felt in all their
incomparable beauty all the more when the tenderness and tragedy of
them, otherwise too poignant, were relieved by the story of his
miraculous birth, his glorious resurrection, and his restored divinity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hebrew metaphors become Greek myths.</div>

<p>The gospel, thus grown acceptable to the pagan mind, was, however, but a
grain of mustard-seed <a name="Page_87" id="Page_87" />destined to branch and flower in its new soil in
a miraculous manner. Not only was the Greek and Roman to refresh himself
under its shade, but birds of other climates were to build their nests,
at least for a season, in its branches. Hebraism, when thus expanded and
paganised, showed many new characteristics native to the minds which had
now adopted and transformed it. The Jews, for instance, like other
Orientals, had a figurative way of speaking and thinking; their poetry
and religion were full of the most violent metaphors. Now to the classic
mind violent and improper metaphors were abhorrent. Uniting, as it did,
clear reason with lively fancy, it could not conceive one thing to <i>be</i>
another, nor relish the figure of speech that so described it, hoping by
that unthinkable phrase to suggest its affinities. But the classic mind
could well conceive transformation, of which indeed nature is full; and
in Greek fables anything might change its form, become something else,
and display its plasticity, not by imperfectly being many things at
once, but by being the perfection of many things in succession. While
metaphor was thus unintelligible and confusing to the Greek,
metamorphosis was perfectly familiar to him. Wherever Hebrew tradition,
accordingly, used violent metaphors, puzzling to the Greek Christian, he
rationalised them by imagining a metamorphosis instead; thus, for
instance, the metaphors of the Last Supper, so harmless and vaguely
satisfying <a name="Page_88" id="Page_88" />to an Oriental audience, became the doctrine of
transubstantiation&mdash;a doctrine where images are indeed lacking to
illustrate the concepts, but where the concepts themselves are not
confused. For that bread should <i>become</i> flesh and wine blood is not
impossible, seeing that the change occurs daily in digestion; what the
assertion in this case contradicts is merely the evidence of sense.</p>

<p>Thus at many a turn in Christian tradition a metaphysical mystery takes
the place of a poetic figure; the former now expressing by a little
miraculous drama the emotion which the latter expressed by a tentative
phrase. And the emotion is thereby immensely clarified and strengthened;
it is, in fact, for the first time really expressed. For the idea that
Christ stands upon the altar and mingles still with our human flesh is
an explicit assertion that his influence and love are perpetual; whereas
the original parable revealed at most the wish and aspiration, contrary
to fact, that they might have been so. By substituting embodiment for
allegory, the Greek mind thus achieved something very congenial to its
habits: it imagined the full and adequate expression, not in words but
in existences, of the emotion to be conveyed. The Eucharist is to the
Last Supper what a centaur is to a horseman or a tragedy to a song.
Similarly a Dantesque conception of hell and paradise embodies in living
detail the innocent apologue in the gospel about a separation of the
sheep from the goats. The result is a chimerical metaphysics,
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89" />containing much which, in reference to existing facts, is absurd; but
that metaphysics, when taken for what it truly is, a new mythology,
utters the subtler secrets of the new religion not less ingeniously and
poetically than pagan mythology reflected the daily shifts in nature and
in human life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hebrew philosophy of history identified with Platonic
cosmology.</div>

<p>Metaphysics became not only a substitute for allegory but at the same
time a background for history. Neo-Platonism had enlarged, in a way
suited to the speculative demands of the time, the cosmos conceived by
Greek science. In an intelligible region, unknown to cosmography and
peopled at first by the Platonic ideas and afterward by Aristotle's
solitary God, there was now the Absolute One, too exalted for any
predicates, but manifesting its essence in the first place in a supreme
Intelligence, the second hypostasis of a Trinity; and in the second
place in the Soul of the World, the third hypostasis, already relative
to natural existence. Now the Platonists conceived these entities to be
permanent and immutable; the physical world itself had a meaning and an
expressive value, like a statue, but no significant history. When the
Jewish notion of creation and divine government of the world presented
itself to the Greeks, they hastened to assimilate it to their familiar
notions of imitation, expression, finality, and significance. And when
the Christians spoke of Christ as the Son of God, who now <a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" />sat at his
right hand in the heavens, their Platonic disciples immediately thought
of the Nous or Logos, the divine Intelligence, incarnate as they had
always believed in the whole world, and yet truly the substance and
essence of divinity. To say that this incarnation had taken place
pre-eminently, or even exclusively, in Christ was not an impossible
concession to make to pious enthusiasm, at least if the philosophy
involved in the old conception could be retained and embodied in the new
orthodoxy. Sacred history could thus be interpreted as a temporal
execution of eternal decrees, and the plan of salvation as an ideal
necessity. Cosmic scope and metaphysical meaning were given to Hebrew
tenets, so unspeculative in their original intention, and it became
possible even for a Platonic philosopher to declare himself a Christian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The resulting orthodox system.</div>

<p>The eclectic Christian philosophy thus engendered constitutes one of the
most complete, elaborate, and impressive products of the human mind. The
ruins of more than one civilisation and of more than one philosophy were
ransacked to furnish materials for this heavenly Byzantium. It was a
myth circumstantial and sober enough in tone to pass for an account of
facts, and yet loaded with enough miracle, poetry, and submerged wisdom
to take the place of a moral philosophy and present what seemed at the
time an adequate ideal to the heart. Many a mortal, in all subsequent
ages, perplexed <a name="Page_91" id="Page_91" />and abandoned in this ungovernable world, has set sail
resolutely for that enchanted island and found there a semblance of
happiness, its narrow limits give so much room for the soul and its
penitential soil breeds so many consolations. True, the brief time and
narrow argument into which Christian imagination squeezes the world must
seem to a speculative pantheist childish and poor, involving, as it
does, a fatuous perversion of nature and history and a ridiculous
emphasis laid on local events and partial interests. Yet just this
violent reduction of things to a human stature, this half-innocent,
half-arrogant assumption that what is important for a man must control
the whole universe, is what made Christian philosophy originally
appealing and what still arouses, in certain quarters, enthusiastic
belief in its beneficence and finality.</p>

<p>Nor should we wonder at this enduring illusion. Man is still in his
childhood; for he cannot respect an ideal which is not imposed on him
against his will, nor can he find satisfaction in a good created by his
own action. He is afraid of a universe that leaves him alone. Freedom
appals him; he can apprehend in it nothing but tedium and desolation, so
immature is he and so barren does he think himself to be. He has to
imagine what the angels would say, so that his own good impulses (which
create those angels) may gain in authority, and none of the dangers that
surround his poor life make the least impression upon him until he
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" />hears that there are hobgoblins hiding in the wood. His moral life, to
take shape at all, must appear to him in fantastic symbols. The history
of these symbols is therefore the history of his soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The brief drama of things.</div>

<p>There was in the beginning, so runs the Christian story, a great
celestial King, wise and good, surrounded by a court of winged musicians
and messengers. He had existed from all eternity, but had always
intended, when the right moment should come, to create temporal beings,
imperfect copies of himself in various degrees. These, of which man was
the chief, began their career in the year 4004 B.C., and they would live
on an indefinite time, possibly, that chronological symmetry might not
be violated, until A.D. 4004. The opening and close of this drama were
marked by two magnificent tableaux. In the first, in obedience to the
word of God, sun, moon, and stars, and earth with all her plants and
animals, assumed their appropriate places, and nature sprang into being
with all her laws. The first man was made out of clay, by a special act
of God, and the first woman was fashioned from one of his ribs,
extracted while he lay in a deep sleep. They were placed in an orchard
where they often could see God, its owner, walking in the cool of the
evening. He suffered them to range at will and eat of all the fruits he
had planted save that of one tree only. But they, incited by a devil,
transgressed this single prohibition, and were ban<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93" />ished from that
paradise with a curse upon their head, the man to live by the sweat of
his brow and the woman to bear children in labour. These children
possessed from the moment of conception the inordinate natures which
their parents had acquired. They were born to sin and to find disorder
and death everywhere within and without them.</p>

<p>At the same time God, lest the work of his hands should wholly perish,
promised to redeem in his good season some of Adam's children and
restore them to a natural life. This redemption was to come ultimately
through a descendant of Eve, whose foot should bruise the head of the
serpent. But it was to be prefigured by many partial and special
redemptions. Thus, Noah was to be saved from the deluge, Lot from Sodom,
Isaac from the sacrifice, Moses from Egypt, the captive Jews from
Babylon, and all faithful souls from heathen forgetfulness and idolatry.
For a certain tribe had been set apart from the beginning to keep alive
the memory of God's judgments and promises, while the rest of mankind,
abandoned to its natural depravity, sank deeper and deeper into crimes
and vanities. The deluge that came to punish these evils did not avail
to cure them. &quot;The world was renewed<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1" /><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and the earth rose again above
the bosom of the waters, but in this renovation there remained eternally
some trace of di<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94" />vine vengeance. Until the deluge all nature had been
exceedingly hardy and vigorous, but by that vast flood of water which
God had spread out over the earth, and by its long abiding there, all
saps were diluted; the air, charged with too dense and heavy a moisture,
bred ranker principles of corruption. The early constitution of the
universe was weakened, and human life, from stretching as it had
formerly done to near a thousand years, grew gradually briefer. Herbs
and roots lost their primitive potency and stronger food had to be
furnished to man by the flesh of other animals.... Death gained upon
life and men felt themselves overtaken by a speedier chastisement. As
day by day they sank deeper in their wickedness, it was but right they
should daily, as it were, stick faster in their woe. The very change in
nourishment made manifest their decline and degradation, since as they
became feebler they became also more voracious and blood-thirsty.&quot;</p>

<p>Henceforth there were two spirits, two parties, or, as Saint Augustine
called them, two cities in the world. The City of Satan, whatever its
artifices in art, war, or philosophy, was essentially corrupt and
impious. Its joy was but a comic mask and its beauty the whitening of a
sepulchre. It stood condemned before God and before man's better
conscience by its vanity, cruelty, and secret misery, by its ignorance
of all that it truly behoved a man to know who was destined to
immortality. Lost, as it seemed, within this Babylon, <a name="Page_95" id="Page_95" />or visible only
in its obscure and forgotten purlieus, lived on at the same time the
City of God, the society of all the souls God predestined to salvation;
a city which, however humble and inconspicuous it might seem on earth,
counted its myriad transfigured citizens in heaven, and had its
destinies, like its foundations, in eternity. To this City of God
belonged, in the first place, the patriarchs and the prophets who,
throughout their plaintive and ardent lives, were faithful to what
echoes still remained of a primeval revelation, and waited patiently for
the greater revelation to come. To the same city belonged the magi who
followed a star till it halted over the stable in Bethlehem; Simeon, who
divined the present salvation of Israel; John the Baptist, who bore
witness to the same and made straight its path; and Peter, to whom not
flesh and blood, but the spirit of the Father in heaven, revealed the
Lord's divinity. For salvation had indeed come with the fulness of time,
not, as the carnal Jews had imagined it, in the form of an earthly
restoration, but through the incarnation of the Son of God in the Virgin
Mary, his death upon a cross, his descent into hell, and his
resurrection at the third day according to the Scriptures. To the same
city belonged finally all those who, believing in the reality and
efficacy of Christ's mission, relied on his merits and followed his
commandment of unearthly love.</p>

<p>All history was henceforth essentially nothing but the conflict between
these two cities; two mo<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96" />ralities, one natural, the other supernatural;
two philosophies, one rational, the other revealed; two beauties, one
corporeal, the other spiritual; two glories, one temporal, the other
eternal; two institutions, one the world, the other the Church. These,
whatever their momentary alliances or compromises, were radically
opposed and fundamentally alien to one another. Their conflict was to
fill the ages until, when wheat and tares had long flourished together
and exhausted between them the earth for whose substance they struggled,
the harvest should come; the terrible day of reckoning when those who
had believed the things of religion to be imaginary would behold with
dismay the Lord visibly coming down through the clouds of heaven, the
angels blowing their alarming trumpets, all generations of the dead
rising from their graves, and judgment without appeal passed on every
man, to the edification of the universal company and his own unspeakable
joy or confusion. Whereupon the blessed would enter eternal bliss with
God their master and the wicked everlasting torments with the devil whom
they served.</p>

<p>The drama of history was thus to close upon a second tableau: long-robed
and beatified cohorts passing above, amid various psalmodies, into an
infinite luminous space, while below the damned, howling, writhing, and
half transformed into loathsome beasts, should be engulfed in a fiery
furnace. The two cities, always opposite in essence, should thus be
finally divided in existence, each bear<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97" />ing its natural fruits and
manifesting its true nature.</p>

<p>Let the reader fill out this outline for himself with its thousand
details; let him remember the endless mysteries, arguments, martyrdoms,
consecrations that carried out the sense and made vital the beauty of
the whole. Let him pause before the phenomenon; he can ill afford, if he
wishes to understand history or the human mind, to let the apparition
float by unchallenged without delivering up its secret. What shall we
say of this Christian dream?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mythology is a language and must be understood to convey
something by symbols.</div>

<p>Those who are still troubled by the fact that this dream is by many
taken for a reality, and who are consequently obliged to defend
themselves against it, as against some dangerous error in science or in
philosophy, may be allowed to marshal arguments in its disproof. Such,
however, is not my intention. Do we marshal arguments against the
miraculous birth of Buddha, or the story of Cronos devouring his
children? We seek rather to honour the piety and to understand the
poetry embodied in those fables. If it be said that those fables are
believed by no one, I reply that those fables are or have been believed
just as unhesitatingly as the Christian theology, and by men no less
reasonable or learned than the unhappy apologists of our own ancestral
creeds. Matters of religion should never <a name="Page_98" id="Page_98" />be matters of controversy. We
neither argue with a lover about his taste, nor condemn him, if we are
just, for knowing so human a passion. That he harbours it is no
indication of a want of sanity on his part in other matters. But while
we acquiesce in his experience, and are glad he has it, we need no
arguments to dissuade us from sharing it. Each man may have his own
loves, but the object in each case is different. And so it is, or should
be, in religion. Before the rise of those strange and fraudulent Hebraic
pretensions there was no question among men about the national,
personal, and poetic character of religious allegiance. It could never
have been a duty to adopt a religion not one's own any more than a
language, a coinage, or a costume not current in one's own country. The
idea that religion contains a literal, not a symbolic, representation of
truth and life is simply an impossible idea. Whoever entertains it has
not come within the region of profitable philosophising on that subject.
His science is not wide enough to cover all existence. He has not
discovered that there can be no moral allegiance except to the ideal.
His certitude and his arguments are no more pertinent to the religious
question than would be the insults, blows, and murders to which, if he
could, he would appeal in the next instance. Philosophy may describe
unreason, as it may describe force; it cannot hope to refute them.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>PAGAN CUSTOM AND BARBARIAN GENIUS INFUSED INTO CHRISTIANITY</p>


<div class="sidenote">Need of paganising Christianity.</div>

<p>The western intellect, in order to accept the gospel, had to sublimate
it into a neo-Platonic system of metaphysics. In like manner the western
heart had to render Christianity congenial and adequate by a rich
infusion of pagan custom and sentiment. This adaptation was more gentle
and facile than might be supposed. We are too much inclined to impute an
abstract and ideal Christianity to the polyglot souls of early
Christians, and to ignore that mysterious and miraculous side of later
paganism from which Christian cultus and ritual are chiefly derived. In
the third century Christianity and devout paganism were, in a religious
sense, closely akin; each differed much less from the other than from
that religion which at other epochs had borne or should bear its own
name. Had Julian the Apostate succeeded in his enterprise he would not
have rescued anything which the admirers of classic paganism could at
all rejoice in; a disciple of Iamblichus could not but plunge headlong
into the same sea of superstition and dialectic which <a name="Page_100" id="Page_100" />had submerged
Christianity. In both parties ethics were irrational and morals corrupt.
The political and humane religion of antiquity had disappeared, and the
question between Christians and pagans amounted simply to a choice of
fanaticisms. Reason had suffered a general eclipse, but civilisation,
although decayed, still subsisted, and a certain scholastic discipline,
a certain speculative habit, and many an ancient religious usage
remained in the world. The people could change their gods, but not the
spirit in which they worshipped them. Christianity had insinuated itself
almost unobserved into a society full of rooted traditions. The first
disciples had been disinherited Jews, with religious habits which men of
other races and interests could never have adopted intelligently; the
Church was accordingly wise enough to perpetuate in its practice at
least an indispensable minimum of popular paganism. How considerable
this minimum was a glance at Catholic piety will suffice to convince us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Catholic piety more human than the liturgy.</div>

<p>The Gr&aelig;co-Jewish system of theology constructed by the Fathers had its
liturgical counterpart in the sacraments and in a devout eloquence which
may be represented to us fairly enough by the Roman missal and breviary.
This liturgy, transfused as it is with pagan philosophy and removed
thereby from the Oriental directness and formlessness of the Bible,
keeps for the most part its theological and patristic tone. Psalms
abound, Virgin, and <a name="Page_101" id="Page_101" />saints are barely mentioned, a certain universalism
and concentration of thought upon the Redemption and its speculative
meaning pervades the Latin ritual sung behind the altar-rails. But any
one who enters a Catholic church with an intelligent interpreter will at
once perceive the immense distance which separates that official and
impersonal ritual from the daily prayers and practices of Catholic
people. The latter refer to the real exigences of daily life and serve
to express or reorganise personal passions. While mass is being
celebrated the old woman will tell her beads, lost in a vague rumination
over her own troubles; while the priests chant something unintelligible
about Abraham or Nebuchadnezzar, the housewife will light her
wax-candles, duly blessed for the occasion, before Saint Barbara, to be
protected thereby from the lightning; and while the preacher is
repeating, by rote, dialectical subtleties about the union of the two
natures in Christ's person, a listener's fancy may float sadly over the
mystery of love and of life, and (being himself without resources in the
premises) he may order a mass to be said for the repose of some departed
soul.</p>

<p>In a Catholic country, every spot and every man has a particular patron.
These patrons are sometimes local worthies, canonised by tradition or by
the Roman see, but no less often they are simply local appellations of
Christ or the Virgin, appellations which are known theoretically to
refer all to the same <i>numen</i>, but which practically possess <a name="Page_102" id="Page_102" />diverse
religious values; for the miracles and intercessions attributed to the
Virgin under one title are far from being miracles and intercessions
attributable to her under another. He who has been all his life devout
to Loreto will not place any special reliance on the Pillar at
Saragossa. A bereaved mother will not fly to the Immaculate Conception
for comfort, but of course to Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows. Each
religious order and all the laity more or less affiliated to it will
cultivate special saints and special mysteries. There are also
particular places and days on which graces are granted, as not on
others, and the quantity of such graces is measurable by canonic
standards. So many days of remitted penance correspond to a work of a
certain merit, for there is a celestial currency in which mulcts and
remissions may be accurately summed and subtracted by angelic recorders.
One man's spiritual earnings may by gift be attributed and imputed to
another, a belief which may seem arbitrary and superstitious but which
is really a natural corollary to fundamental doctrines like the
atonement, the communion of saints, and intercession for the dead and
living.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural pieties.</div>

<p>Another phase of the same natural religion is seen in frequent
festivals, in the consecration of buildings, ships, fields, labours, and
seasons; in intercessions by the greater dead for the living and by the
living for the lesser dead&mdash;a perfect survival of heroes and penates on
the one hand and of pagan funeral rites and com<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" />memorations on the
other. Add Lent with its carnival, ember-days, all saints' and all
souls', Christmas with its magi or its Saint Nicholas, Saint Agnes's and
Saint Valentine's days with their profane associations, a saint for
finding lost objects and another for prospering amourettes, since all
great and tragic loves have their inevitable patrons in Christ and the
Virgin, in Mary Magdalene, and in the mystics innumerable. This, with
what more could easily be rehearsed, makes a complete paganism within
Christian tradition, a paganism for which little basis can be found in
the gospel, the mass, the breviary, or the theologians.</p>

<p>Yet these accretions were as well authenticated as the substructure, for
they rested on human nature. To feel, for instance, the special efficacy
of your village Virgin or of the miraculous Christ whose hermitage is
perched on the overhanging hill, is a genuine experience. The principle
of it is clear and simple. Those shrines, those images, the festivals
associated with them, have entered your mind together with your earliest
feelings. Your first glimpses of mortal vicissitudes have coincided with
the awe and glitter of sacramental moments in which those <i>numina</i> were
invoked; and on that deeper level of experience, in those lower reaches
of irrationalism in which such impressions lie, they constitute a mystic
resource subsisting beneath all conventions and overt knowledge. When
the doctors blunder&mdash;as they commonly do&mdash;the saints may find a cure;
after all, the saints' success in <a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" />medicine seems to a crude empiricism
almost as probable as the physicians'. Special and local patrons are the
original gods, and whatever religious value speculative and cosmic
deities retain they retain surreptitiously, by virtue of those very
bonds with human interests and passionate desires which ancestral demons
once borrowed from the hearth they guarded, the mountain they haunted,
or the sacrifice they inhaled with pleasure, until their hearts softened
toward their worshippers. In itself, and as a minimised and retreating
theology represents it, a universal power has no specific energy, no
determinate interest at heart; there is nothing friendly about it nor
allied to your private necessities; no links of place and time fortify
and define its influence. Nor is it rational to appeal for a mitigation
of evils or for assistance against them to the very being that has
decreed and is inflicting them for some fixed purpose of its own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Refuge taken in the supernatural.</div>

<p>Paganism or natural religion was at first, like so many crude religious
notions, optimistic and material; the worshipper expected his piety to
make his pot boil, to cure his disease, to prosper his battles, and to
render harmless his ignorance of the world in which he lived. But such
faith ran up immediately against the facts; it was discountenanced at
every turn by experience and reflection. The whole of nature and life,
when they are understood at all, have to be understood on an opposite
principle, on the principle that fate, having naturally <a name="Page_105" id="Page_105" />furnished us
with a determinate will and a determinate endowment, gives us a free
field and no favour in a natural world. Hence the retreat of religion to
the supernatural, a region to which in its cruder forms it was far from
belonging. Now this retreat, in the case of classic paganism, took place
with the decay of military and political life and would have produced an
ascetic popular system, some compound of Oriental and Greek traditions,
even if Christianity had not intervened at that juncture and opportunely
pre-empted the ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The episodes of life consecrated mystically.</div>

<p>Christianity, as we have seen, had elements in it which gave it a
decisive advantage; its outlook was historical, not cosmic, and
consequently admitted a non-natural future for the individual and for
the Church; it was anti-political and looked for progress only in that
region in which progress was at that time possible, in the private soul;
it was democratic, feminine, and unworldly; its Oriental deity and
prophets had a primitive simplicity and pathos not found in pagan heroes
or polite metaphysical entities; its obscure Hebrew poetry opened, like
music, an infinite field for brooding fancy and presumption. The
consequence was a doubling of the world, so that every Christian led a
dual existence, one full of trouble and vanity on earth, which it was
piety in him to despise and neglect, another full of hope and
consolation in a region parallel to earth and directly above it, every
part of which <a name="Page_106" id="Page_106" />corresponded to something in earthly life and could be
reached, so to speak, by a Jacob's ladder upon which aspiration and
grace ascended and descended continually. Birth had its sacramental
consecration to the supernatural in baptism, growth in confirmation,
self-consciousness in confession, puberty in communion, effort in
prayer, defeat in sacrifice, sin in penance, speculation in revealed
wisdom, art in worship, natural kindness in charity, poverty in
humility, death in self-surrender and resurrection. When the mind grew
tired of contemplation the lips could still echo some pious petition,
keeping the body's attitude and habit expressive of humility and
propitious to receiving grace; and when the knees and lips were
themselves weary, a candle might be left burning before the altar, to
witness that the desire momentarily forgotten was not extinguished in
the heart. Through prayer and religious works the absent could be
reached and the dead helped on their journey, and amid earthly
estrangements and injustices there always remained the church open to
all and the society of heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Paganism chastened, Hebraism liberalised.</div>

<p>Nothing is accordingly more patent than that Christianity was paganised
by the early Church; indeed, the creation of the Church was itself what
to a Hebraising mind must seem a corruption, namely, a mixing of pagan
philosophy and ritual with the Gospel. But this sort of constitutive
corruption would more properly be called an adaptation, an absorption,
or even a civilisation of Hebraism; for by this mar<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107" />riage with paganism
Christianity fitted itself to live and work in the civilised world. By
this corruption it was completed and immensely improved, like
Anglo-Saxon by its corruption through French and Latin; for it is always
an improvement in religion, whose business is to express and inspire
spiritual sentiment, that it should learn to express and inspire that
sentiment more generously. Paganism was nearer than Hebraism to the Life
of Reason because its myths were more transparent and its temper less
fanatical; and so a paganised Christianity approached more closely that
ideality which constitutes religious truth than a bare and intense
Hebraism, in its hostility to human genius, could ever have done if
isolated and unqualified.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The system post-rational and founded on despair.</div>

<p>The Christianity which the pagans adopted, in becoming itself pagan,
remained a religion natural to their country and their heart. It
constituted a paganism expressive of their later and calamitous
experience, a paganism acquainted with sorrow, a religion that had
passed through both civilisation and despair, and had been reduced to
translating the eclipsed values of life into supernatural symbols. It
became a post-rational religion. Of course, to understand such a system
it is necessary to possess the faculties it exercises and the experience
it represents. Where life has not reached the level of reflection,
religion and philosophy must both be pre-rational; they must remain
crudely experimental, unconscious of the limits of excellence and <a name="Page_108" id="Page_108" />life.
Under such circumstances it is obviously impossible that religion should
be reconstituted on a supernatural plane, or should learn to express
experience rather than impulse. Now the Christianity of the gospels was
itself post-rational; it had turned its back on the world. In this
respect the mixture with paganism altered nothing; it merely reinforced
the spiritualised and lyric despair of the Hebrews with the personal and
metaphysical despair of the Romans and Greeks. For all the later classic
philosophy&mdash;Stoic, Sceptic, or Epicurean&mdash;was founded on despair and was
post-rational. Pagan Christianity, or Catholicism, may accordingly be
said to consist of two elements: first, the genius of paganism, the
faculty of expressing spiritual experience in myth and external symbol,
and, second, the experience of disillusion, forcing that pagan
imagination to take wing from earth and to decorate no longer the
political and material circumstances of life, but rather to remove
beyond the clouds and constitute its realm of spirit beyond the veil of
time and nature, in a posthumous and metaphysical sphere. A mythical
economy abounding in points of attachment to human experience and in
genial interpretations of life, yet lifted beyond visible nature and
filling a reported world, a world believed in on hearsay or, as it is
called, on faith&mdash;that is Catholicism.</p>

<p>When this religion was established in the Roman Empire, that empire was
itself threatened by the barbarians who soon permeated and occupied <a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" />it
and made a new and unhappy beginning to European history. They adopted
Christianity, not because it represented their religious needs or
inspiration, but because it formed part of a culture and a social
organisation the influence of which they had not, in their simplicity,
the means to withstand. During several ages they could only modify by
their misunderstandings and inertia arts wholly new to their lives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">External conversion of the barbarians.</div>

<p>What sort of religion these barbarians may previously have had is beyond
our accurate knowledge. They handed down a mythology not radically
different from the Gr&aelig;co-Roman, though more vaguely and grotesquely
conceived; and they recognised tribal duties and glories from which
religious sanctions could hardly have been absent. But a barbarian mind,
like a child's, is easy to convert and to people with what stories you
will. The Northmen drank in with pleased astonishment what the monks
told them about hell and heaven, God the Father and God the Son, the
Virgin and the beautiful angels; they accepted the sacraments with vague
docility; they showed a qualified respect, often broken upon, it is
true, by instinctive rebellions, for a clergy which after all
represented whatever vestiges of learning, benevolence, or art still
lingered in the world. But this easy and boasted conversion was fanciful
only and skin-deep. A non-Christian ethics of valour and honour, a
non-Christian fund of superstition, legend, and senti<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110" />ment, subsisted
always among medi&aelig;val peoples. Their soul, so largely inarticulate,
might be overlaid with churchly habits and imprisoned for the moment in
the panoply of patristic dogma; but pagan Christianity always remained a
religion foreign to them, accepted only while their minds continued in a
state of helpless tutelage. Such a foreign religion could never be
understood by them in its genuine motives and spirit. They were without
the experience and the plastic imagination which had given it birth. It
might catch them unawares and prevail over them for a time, but even
during that period it could not root out from barbarian souls anything
opposed to it which subsisted there. It was thus that the Roman Church
hatched the duck's egg of Protestantism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expression of the northern genius within Catholicism.</div>

<p>In its native seats the Catholic system prompts among those who inwardly
reject it satire and indifference rather than heresy, because on the
whole it expresses well enough the religious instincts of the people.
Only those strenuously oppose it who hate religion itself. But among
converted barbarians the case was naturally different, and opposition to
the Church came most vehemently from certain religious natures whose
instincts it outraged or left unsatisfied. Even before heresy burst
forth this religious restlessness found vent in many directions. It
endowed Christianity with several beautiful but insidious gifts, several
incongruous though well-meant forms of expression. Among these we <a name="Page_111" id="Page_111" />may
count Gothic art, chivalrous sentiment, and even scholastic philosophy.
These things came, as we know, ostensibly to serve Christianity, which
has learned to regard them as its own emanations. But in truth they
barbarised Christianity just as Greek philosophy and worship and Roman
habits of administration had paganised it in the beginning. And
barbarised Christianity, even before it became heretical, was something
new, something very different in temper and beauty from the pagan
Christianity of the South and East.</p>

<p>In the Catholicism of the Middle Ages, as it flourished in the North,
the barbarian soul, apprenticed to monkish masters, appeared in all its
childlike trust, originality, and humour. There was something touching
and grotesque about it. We seem to see a child playing with the toys of
age, his green hopes and fancies weaving themselves about an antique
metaphysical monument, the sanctuary of a decrepit world. The structure
of that monument was at first not affected, and even when it had been
undermined and partially ruined, its style could not be transformed,
but, clad in its northern ivy, it wore at once a new aspect. To races
without experience&mdash;that is, without cumulative traditions or a visible
past&mdash;Christianity could be nothing but a fairy story and a gratuitous
hope, as if they had been told about the Sultan of Timbuctoo and
promised that they should some day ride on his winged Arabian horses.
The tragic meaning of the Christian faith, <a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" />its immense renunciation of
all things earthly and the merely metaphysical glory of its transfigured
life, commonly escaped their apprehension, as it still continues to do.
They listened open-mouthed to the missionary and accepted his
asseverations with unsuspecting emotion, like the Anglo-Saxon king who
likened the soul to a bird flying in and out of a tent at night, about
whose further fortunes any account would be interesting to hear. A seed
planted in such a virgin and uncultivated soil must needs bring forth
fruit of a new savour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Internal discrepancies between the two.</div>

<p>In northern Christianity a fresh quality of brooding tenderness
prevailed over the tragic passion elsewhere characteristic of Catholic
devotion. Intricacy was substituted for dignity and poetry for rhetoric;
the basilica became an abbey and the hermitage a school. The feudal ages
were a wonderful seed-time in a world all gaunt with ruins. Horrors were
there mingled with delicacies and confusion with idyllic peace. It was
here a poet's childhood passed amid the crash of war, there an
alchemist's old age flickering away amid cobwebs and gibberish.
Something jocund and mischievous peeped out even in the cloister;
gargoyles leered from the belfry, while ivy and holly grew about the
cross. The Middle Ages were the true renaissance. Their Christianity was
the theme, the occasion, the excuse for their art and jollity, their
curiosity and tenderness; it was far from being the source of <a name="Page_113" id="Page_113" />those
delightful inventions. The Crusades were not inspired by the Prince of
Peace, to whose honour they were fancifully and passionately dedicated;
so chivalry, Gothic architecture, and scholastic philosophy were profane
expressions of a self-discovering genius in a people incidentally
Christian. The barbarians had indeed been indoctrinated, they had been
introduced into an alien spiritual and historic medium, but they had not
been made over or inwardly tamed. It had perhaps been rendered easier
for them, by contact with an existing or remembered civilisation, to
mature their own genius, even in the act of confusing its expression
through foreign accretions. They had been thereby stimulated to civilise
themselves and encouraged also to believe themselves civilised somewhat
prematurely, when they had become heirs merely to the titles and
trappings of civilisation.</p>

<p>The process of finding their own art and polity, begun under foreign
guidance, was bound on the whole to diverge more and more from its Latin
model. It consisted now of imitation, now of revulsion and fanciful
originality; never was a race so much under the sway of fashions.
Fashion is something barbarous, for it produces innovation without
reason and imitation without benefit. It marks very clearly that margin
of irresponsible variation in manners and thoughts which among a people
artificially civilised may so easily be larger than the solid core. <a name="Page_114" id="Page_114" />It
is characteristic of occidental society in medi&aelig;val and modern times,
because this society is led by people who, being educated in a foreign
culture, remain barbarians at heart. To this day we have not achieved a
really native civilisation. Our art, morals, and religion, though deeply
dyed in native feeling, are still only definable and, indeed,
conceivable by reference to classic and alien standards. Among the
northern races culture is even more artificial and superinduced than
among the southern; whence the strange phenomenon of snobbery in
society, affectation in art, and a violent contrast between the educated
and the uneducated, the rich and the poor, classes that live on
different intellectual planes and often have different religions. Some
educated persons, accordingly, are merely students and imbibers; they
sit at the feet of a past which, not being really theirs, can produce no
fruit in them but sentimentality. Others are merely <i>protestants</i>; they
are active in the moral sphere only by virtue of an inward rebellion
against something greater and overshadowing, yet repulsive and alien.
They are conscious truants from a foreign school of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tradition and instinct at odds in Protestantism.</div>

<p>In the Protestant religion it is necessary to distinguish inner
inspiration from historical entanglements. Unfortunately, as the whole
doctrinal form of this religion is irrelevant to its spirit and imposed
from without, being due to the step-motherly nurture it received from
the Church, we can reach a con<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115" />ception of its inner spirit only by
studying its tendency and laws of change or its incidental expression in
literature and custom. Yet these indirect symptoms are so striking that
even an outsider, if at all observant, need not fear to misinterpret
them. Taken externally, Protestantism is, of course, a form of
Christianity; it retains the Bible and a more or less copious selection
of patristic doctrines. But in its spirit and inward inspiration it is
something quite as independent of Judea as of Rome. It is simply the
natural religion of the Teutons raising its head above the flood of
Roman and Judean influences. Its character may be indicated by saying
that it is a religion of pure spontaneity, of emotional freedom, deeply
respecting itself but scarcely deciphering its purposes. It is the
self-consciousness of a spirit in process of incubation, jealous of its
potentialities, averse to definitions and finalities of any kind because
it can itself discern nothing fixed or final. It is adventurous and
puzzled by the world, full of rudimentary virtues and clear fire,
energetic, faithful, rebellious to experience, inexpert in all matters
of art and mind. It boasts, not without cause, of its depth and purity;
but this depth and purity are those of any formless and primordial
substance. It keeps unsullied that antecedent integrity which is at the
bottom of every living thing and at its core; it is not acquainted with
that ulterior integrity, that sanctity, which might be attained at the
summit of experience through reason and specu<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" />lative dominion. It
accordingly mistakes vitality, both in itself and in the universe, for
spiritual life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Protestant spirit remote from that of the gospel.</div>

<p>This underlying Teutonic religion, which we must call Protestantism for
lack of a better name, is anterior to Christianity and can survive it.
To identify it with the Gospel may have seemed possible so long as, in
opposition to pagan Christianity, the Teutonic spirit could appeal to
the Gospel for support. The Gospel has indeed nothing pagan about it,
but it has also nothing Teutonic; and the momentary alliance of two such
disparate forces must naturally cease with the removal of the common
enemy which alone united them. The Gospel is unworldly, disenchanted,
ascetic; it treats ecclesiastical establishments with tolerant contempt,
conforming to them with indifference; it regards prosperity as a danger,
earthly ties as a burden, Sabbaths as a superstition; it revels in
miracles; it is democratic and antinomian; it loves contemplation,
poverty, and solitude; it meets sinners with sympathy and heartfelt
forgiveness, but Pharisees and Puritans with biting scorn. In a word, it
is a product of the Orient, where all things are old and equal and a
profound indifference to the business of earth breeds a silent dignity
and high sadness in the spirit. Protestantism is the exact opposite of
all this. It is convinced of the importance of success and prosperity;
it abomi<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117" />nates what is disreputable; contemplation seems to it idleness,
solitude selfishness, and poverty a sort of dishonourable punishment. It
is constrained and punctilious in righteousness; it regards a married
and industrious life as typically godly, and there is a sacredness to
it, as of a vacant Sabbath, in the unoccupied higher spaces which such
an existence leaves for the soul. It is sentimental, its ritual is
meagre and unctuous, it expects no miracles, it thinks optimism akin to
piety, and regards profitable enterprise and practical ambition as a
sort of moral vocation. Its Evangelicalism lacks the notes, so prominent
in the gospel, of disillusion, humility, and speculative detachment. Its
benevolence is optimistic and aims at raising men to a conventional
well-being; it thus misses the inner appeal of Christian charity which,
being merely remedial in physical matters, begins by renunciation and
looks to spiritual freedom and peace.</p>

<p>Protestantism was therefore attached from the first to the Old
Testament, in which Hebrew fervour appears in its worldly and
pre-rational form. It is not democratic in the same sense as
post-rational religions, which see in the soul an exile from some other
sphere wearing for the moment, perhaps, a beggar's disguise: it is
democratic only in the sense of having a popular origin and bending
easily to popular forces. Swayed as it is by public opinion, it is
necessarily conventional in its conception of duty and earnestly
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118" />materialistic; for the meaning of the word vanity never crosses the
vulgar heart. In fine, it is the religion of a race young, wistful, and
adventurous, feeling its latent potentialities, vaguely assured of an
earthly vocation, and possessing, like the barbarian and the healthy
child, pure but unchastened energies. Thus in the Protestant religion
the faith natural to barbarism appears clothed, by force of historical
accident, in the language of an adapted Christianity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Obstacles to humanism.</div>

<p>As the Middle Ages advanced the new-born human genius which constituted
their culture grew daily more playful, curious, and ornate. It was
naturally in the countries formerly pagan that this new paganism
principally flourished. Religion began in certain quarters to be taken
philosophically; its relation to life began to be understood, that it
was a poetic expression of need, hope, and ignorance. Here prodigious
vested interests and vested illusions of every sort made dangerous the
path of sincerity. Genuine moral and religious impulses could not be
easily dissociated from a system of thought and discipline with which
for a thousand years they had been intimately interwoven. Scepticism,
instead of seeming, what it naturally is, a moral force, a tendency to
sincerity, economy, and fine adjustment of life and mind to
experience&mdash;scepticism seemed a temptation and a danger. This situation,
which still prevails in a certain measure, strikingly shows into how
arti<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" />ficial a posture Christianity has thrown the mind. If scepticism,
under such circumstances, by chance penetrated among the clergy, it was
not favourable to consistency of life, and it was the more certain to
penetrate among them in that their ranks, in a fat and unscrupulous age,
would naturally be largely recruited by men without conscience or ideal
ambitions. It became accordingly necessary to reform something; either
the gay world to suit the Church's primitive austerity and asceticism,
or the Church to suit the world's profane and general interests. The
latter task was more or less consciously undertaken by the humanists who
would have abated the clergy's wealth and irrational authority, advanced
polite learning, and, while of course retaining Christianity&mdash;for why
should an ancestral religion be changed?&mdash;would have retained it as a
form of paganism, as an ornament and poetic expression of human life.
This movement, had it not been overwhelmed by the fanatical Reformation
and the fanatical reaction against it, would doubtless have met with
many a check from the Church's sincere zealots; but it could have
overcome them and, had it been allowed to fight reason's battle with
reason's weapons, would ultimately have led to general enlightenment
without dividing Christendom, kindling venomous religious and national
passions, or vitiating philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Reformation and counter-reformation.</div>

<p>It was not humanism, however, that was destined to restrain and soften
the Church, com<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120" />pleting by critical reflection that paganisation of
Christianity which had taken place at the beginning instinctively and of
necessity. There was now another force in the field, the virgin
conscience and wilfulness of the Teutonic races, sincerely attached to
what they had assimilated in Christianity and now awakening to the fact
that they inwardly abhorred and rejected the rest. This situation, in so
uncritical an age, could be interpreted as a return to primitive
Christianity, though this had been in truth, as we may now perceive,
utterly opposed to the Teutonic spirit. Accordingly, the humanistic
movement was crossed and obscured by another, specifically religious and
ostensibly more Christian than the Church. Controversies followed, as
puerile as they were bloody; for it was not to be expected that the
peoples once forming the Roman Empire were going to surrender their
ancestral religion without a struggle and without resisting this new
barbarian invasion into their imaginations and their souls. They might
have suffered their Christianised paganism to fade with time; worldly
prosperity and arts might have weaned them gradually from their
supernaturalism, and science from their myths; but how were they to
abandon at once all their traditions, when challenged to do so by a
foreign supernaturalism so much poorer and cruder than their own? What
happened was that they intrenched themselves <a name="Page_121" id="Page_121" />in their system, cut
themselves off from the genial influences that might have rendered it
innocuous, and became sectaries, like their opponents. Enlightenment was
only to come after a recrudescence of madness and by the mutual
slaughter of a fresh crop of illusions, usurpations, and tyrannies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Protestantism an expression of character.</div>

<p>It would be easy to write, in a satirical vein, the history of
Protestant dogma. Its history was foreseen from the beginning by
intelligent observers. It consisted in a gradual and inevitable descent
into a pious scepticism. The attempt to cling to various intermediate
positions on the inclined plane that slopes down from ancient revelation
to private experience can succeed only for a time and where local
influences limit speculative freedom. You must slide smilingly down to
the bottom or, in horror at that eventuality, creep up again and reach
out pathetically for a resting-place at the top. To insist on this
rather obvious situation, as exhibited for instance in the Anglican
Church, would be to thresh straw and to study in Protestantism only its
feeble and accidental side. Its true essence is not constituted by the
Christian dogmas that at a given moment it chances to retain, but by the
spirit in which it constantly challenges the others, by the expression
it gives to personal integrity, to faith in conscience, to human
instinct courageously meeting the world. It rebels, for <a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" />instance,
against the Catholic system of measurable sins and merits, with rewards
and punishments legally adjusted and controlled by priestly as well as
by divine prerogative. Such a supernatural mechanism seems to an
independent and uncowed nature a profanation and an imposture. Away, it
says, with all intermediaries between the soul and God, with all
meddlesome priestcraft and all mechanical salvation. Salvation shall be
by faith alone, that is, by an attitude and sentiment private to the
spirit, by an inner co-operation of man with the world. The Church shall
be invisible, constituted by all those who possess this necessary faith
and by no others. It really follows from this, although the conclusion
may not be immediately drawn, that religion is not an adjustment to
other facts or powers, or to other possibilities, than those met with in
daily life and in surrounding nature, but is rather a spiritual
adjustment to natural life, an insight into its principles, by which a
man learns to identify himself with the cosmic power and to share its
multifarious business no less than its ulterior security and calm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It has the spirit of life.</div>

<p>Protestantism, in this perfectly instinctive trustfulness and
self-assertion, is not only prior to Christianity but more primitive
than reason and even than man. The plants and animals, if they could
speak, would express their attitude to their destiny in the Protestant
fashion. &quot;He that formed us,&quot; they <a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" />would say, &quot;lives and energises
within us. He has sealed a covenant with us, to stand by us if we are
faithful and strenuous in following the suggestions he whispers in our
hearts. With fidelity to ourselves and, what is the same thing, to him,
we are bound to prosper and to have life more and more abundantly for
ever.&quot; This attitude, where it concerns religion, involves two
corollaries: first, what in accordance with Hebrew precedent may be
called symbolically faith in God, that is, confidence in one's own
impulse and destiny, a confidence which the world in the end is sure to
reward; and second, abomination of all contrary religious tenets and
practices&mdash;of asceticism, for instance, because it denies the will; of
idolatry and myth, because they render divinity concrete rather than
relative to inner cravings and essentially responsive; finally of
tradition and institutional authority, because these likewise jeopardise
the soul's experimental development as, in profound isolation, she
wrestles with reality and with her own inspiration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and of courage.</div>

<p>In thus meeting the world the soul without experience shows a fine
courage proportionate to its own vigour. We may well imagine that lions
and porpoises have a more masculine assurance that God is on their side
than ever visits the breast of antelope or jelly-fish. This assurance,
when put to the test in adventurous living, becomes in a strong and
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" />high-bred creature a refusal to be defeated, a gallant determination to
hold the last ditch and hope for the best in spite of appearances. It is
a part of Protestantism to be austere, energetic, unwearied in some
laborious task. The end and profit are not so much regarded as the mere
habit of self-control and practical devotion and steadiness. The point
is to accomplish something, no matter particularly what; so that
Protestants show on this ground some respect even for an artist when he
has once achieved success. A certain experience of ill fortune is only a
stimulus to this fidelity. So great is the antecedent trust in the world
that the world, as it appears at first blush, may be confidently defied.</p>

<div class="sidenote">but the voice of inexperience.</div>

<p>Hence, in spite of a theoretic optimism, disapproval and proscription
play a large part in Protestant sentiment. The zeal for righteousness,
the practical expectation that all shall be well, cannot tolerate
recognised evils. Evils must be abolished or at least hidden; they must
not offend the face of day and give the lie to universal sanctimony.
This austerity and repression, though they involve occasional hypocrisy,
lead also to substantial moral reconstruction. Protestantism, springing
from a pure heart, purifies convention and is a tonic to any society in
which it prominently exists. It has the secret of that honest simplicity
which belongs to unspoiled youth, that keen integrity native to the
ungalled spirit as yet unconscious <a name="Page_125" id="Page_125" />of any duplicity in itself or of any
inward reason why it should fail. The only evils it recognises seem so
many challenges to action, so many conditions for some glorious
unthought-of victory. Such a religion is indeed profoundly ignorant, it
is the religion of inexperience, yet it has, at its core, the very
spirit of life. Its error is only to consider the will omnipotent and
sacred and not to distinguish the field of inevitable failure from that
of possible success. Success, however, would never be possible without
that fund of energy and that latent resolve and determination which
bring also faith in success. Animal optimism is a great renovator and
disinfectant in the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its emancipation from Christianity.</div>

<p>It was this youthful religion&mdash;profound, barbaric, poetical&mdash;that the
Teutonic races insinuated into Christianity and substituted for that
last sigh of two expiring worlds. In the end, with the complete
crumbling away of Christian dogma and tradition, Absolute Egotism
appeared openly on the surface in the shape of German speculative
philosophy. This form, which Protestantism assumed at a moment of high
tension and reckless self-sufficiency, it will doubtless shed in turn
and take on new expressions; but that declaration of independence on the
part of the Teutonic spirit marks emphatically its exit from
Christianity and the end of that series of transformations in which it
took the Bible and patristic <a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" />dogma for its materials. It now bids fair
to apply itself instead to social life and natural science and to
attempt to feed its Protean hunger directly from these more homely
sources.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>CONFLICT OF MYTHOLOGY WITH MORAL TRUTH</p>


<div class="sidenote">Myth should dissolve with the advance of science.</div>

<p>That magic and mythology have no experimental sanction is clear so soon
as experience begins to be gathered together with any care. As magic
attempts to do work by incantations, so myth tries to attain knowledge
by playing with lies. The attempt is in the first instance inevitable
and even innocent, for it takes time to discriminate valid from
valueless fancies in a mind in which they spring up together, with no
intrinsic mark to distinguish them. The idle notion attracts attention
no less than the one destined to prove significant; often it pleases
more. Only watchful eyes and that rare thing, conscience applied to
memory, can pluck working notions from the gay and lascivious vegetation
of the mind, or learn to prefer Cinderella to her impudent sisters. If a
myth has some modicum of applicability or significance it takes root all
the more firmly side by side with knowledge. There are many subjects of
which man is naturally so ignorant that only mythical notions can seem
to do them justice; such, for instance, are the <a name="Page_128" id="Page_128" />minds of other men.
Myth remains for this reason a constituent part even of the most
rational consciousness, and what can at present be profitably attempted
is not so much to abolish myth as to become aware of its mythical
character.</p>

<p>The mark of a myth is that it does not interpret a phenomenon in terms
capable of being subsumed under the same category with that phenomenon
itself, but fills it out instead with images that could never appear
side by side with it or complete it on its own plane of existence. Thus
if meditating on the moon I conceive her other side or the aspect she
would wear if I were travelling on her surface, or the position she
would assume in relation to the earth if viewed from some other planet,
or the structure she would disclose could she be cut in halves, my
thinking, however fanciful, would be on the scientific plane and not
mythical, for it would forecast possible perceptions, complementary to
those I am trying to enlarge. If, on the other hand, I say the moon is
the sun's sister, that she carries a silver bow, that she is a virgin
and once looked lovingly on the sleeping Endymion, only the fool never
knew it&mdash;my lucubration is mythical; for I do not pretend that this
embroidery on the aspects which the moon actually wears in my feeling
and in the interstices of my thoughts could ever be translated into
perceptions making one system with the present image. By going closer to
that disc <a name="Page_129" id="Page_129" />I should not see the silver bow, nor by retreating in time
should I come to the moment when the sun and moon were actually born of
Latona. The elements are incongruous and do not form one existence but
two, the first sensible, the other only to be enacted dramatically, and
having at best to the first the relation of an experience to its symbol.
These fancies are not fore-tastes of possible perceptions, but are free
interpretations or translations of the perceptions I have actually had.</p>

<p>Mythical thinking has its roots in reality, but, like a plant, touches
the ground only at one end. It stands unmoved and flowers wantonly into
the air, transmuting into unexpected and richer forms the substances it
sucks from the soil. It is therefore a fruit of experience, an ornament,
a proof of animal vitality; but it is no <i>vehicle</i> for experience; it
cannot serve the purposes of transitive thought or action. Science, on
the other hand, is constituted by those fancies which, arising like
myths out of perception, retain a sensuous language and point to further
perceptions of the same kind; so that the suggestions drawn from one
object perceived are only ideas of other objects similarly perceptible.
A scientific hypothesis is one which represents something continuous
with the observed facts and conceivably existent in the same medium.
Science is a bridge touching experience at both ends, over which
practical thought may travel <a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" />from act to act, from perception to
perception.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But myth is confused with the moral values it expresses.</div>

<p>To separate fable from knowledge nothing is therefore requisite except
close scrutiny and the principle of parsimony. Were mythology merely a
poetic substitute for natural science the advance of science would
sufficiently dispose of it. What remained over would, like the myths in
Plato, be at least better than total silence on a subject that interests
us and makes us think, although we have no means of testing our thoughts
in its regard. But the chief source of perplexity and confusion in
mythology is its confusion with moral truth. The myth which originally
was but a symbol substituted for empirical descriptions becomes in the
sequel an idol substituted for ideal values. This complication, from
which half the troubles of philosophy arise, deserves our careful
attention.</p>

<p>European history has now come twice upon the dissolution of mythologies,
first among the Stoics and then among the Protestants. The circumstances
in the two cases were very unlike; so were the mythical systems that
were discarded; and yet the issue was in both instances similar. Greek
and Christian mythology have alike ended in pantheism. So soon as the
constructions of the poets and the Fathers were seen to be ingenious
fictions, criticism was confronted with an obvious duty: to break up the
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131" />mythical compound furnished by tradition into its elements, putting on
one side what natural observation or actual history had supplied, and on
the other what dramatic imagination had added. For a cool and
disinterested observer the task, where evidence and records were not
wanting, would be simple enough. But the critic in this case would not
usually be cool or disinterested. His religion was concerned; he had no
other object to hang his faith and happiness upon than just this
traditional hybrid which his own enlightenment was now dissolving. To
which part should he turn for support? In which quarter should he
continue to place the object of his worship?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Neo-Platonic revision.</div>

<p>From the age of the Sophists to the final disappearance of paganism
nearly a thousand years elapsed. A thousand years from the infliction of
a mortal wound to the moment of extinction is a long agony. Religions do
not disappear when they are discredited; it is requisite that they
should be replaced. For a thousand years the augurs may have laughed,
they were bound nevertheless to stand at their posts until the monks
came to relieve them. During this prolonged decrepitude paganism lived
on inertia, by accretions from the Orient, and by philosophic
reinterpretations. Of these reinterpretations the first was that
attempted by Plato, and afterward carried out by the neo-Platonists and
Christians into the notion of <a name="Page_132" id="Page_132" />a supernatural spiritual hierarchy;
above, a dialectical deity, the hypostasis of intellect and its
ontological phases; below, a host of angels and demons, hypostases of
faculties, moral influences, and evil promptings. In other words, in the
diremption of myths which yielded here a natural phenomenon to be
explained and there a moral value to be embodied, Platonism attached
divinity exclusively to the moral element. The ideas, which were
essentially moral functions, were many and eternal; their physical
embodiments were adventitious to them and constituted a lapse, a
misfortune to be wiped out by an eventual reunion of the alienated
nature with its own ideal. Religion in such a system necessarily meant
redemption. In this movement paganism turned toward the future, toward
supernatural and revealed religion, and away from its own naturalistic
principle. Revelation, as Plato himself had said, was needed to guide a
mind which distrusted phenomena and recoiled from earthly pursuits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It made mythical entities of abstractions.</div>

<p>This religion had the strength of despair, but all else in it was
weakness. Apart from a revelation which, until Christianity appeared,
remained nebulous and arbitrary, there could be no means of maintaining
the existence of those hypostasised moral entities. The effort to
separate them from the natural functions which they evidently expressed
could not succeed while any critical acumen or independence subsisted in
the believer. Platonism, to become a re<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133" />ligion, had to appeal to
superstition. Unity, for instance (which, according to Plato himself, is
a category applicable to everything concomitantly with the complementary
category of multiplicity, for everything, he says, is evidently both one
and many)&mdash;unity could not become the One, an independent and supreme
deity, unless the meaning and function of unity were altogether
forgotten and a foolish idolatry, agape at words, were substituted for
understanding. Some one had to come with an air of authority and report
his visions of the One before such an entity could be added to the
catalogue of actual existences. The reality of all neo-Platonic
hypostasis was thus dependent on revelation and on forgetting the
meaning once conveyed by the terms so mysteriously transfigured into
metaphysical beings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hypostasis ruins ideals.</div>

<p>This divorce of neo-Platonic ideas from the functions they originally
represented in human life and discourse was found in the end to defeat
the very interest that had prompted it&mdash;enthusiasm for the ideal.
Enthusiasm for the ideal had led Plato to treat all beauties as
stepping-stones toward a perfect beauty in which all their charms might
be present together, eternally and without alloy. Enthusiasm for the
ideal had persuaded him that mortal life was only an impeded effort to
fall back into eternity. These inspired but strictly unthinkable
suggestions fell from his lips in his zeal to express how much the
burden and import of experience exceeded its sensuous vehicle <a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" />in
permanence and value. A thousand triangles revealed one pregnant
proportion of lines and areas; a thousand beds and bridles served one
perpetual purpose in human life, and found in fulfilling it their
essence and standard of excellence; a thousand fascinations taught the
same lesson and coalesced into one reverent devotion to beauty and
nobility wherever they might bloom. It was accordingly a poignant sense
for the excellence of real things that made Plato wish to transcend
them; his metaphysics was nothing but a visionary intuition of values,
an idealism in the proper sense of the word. But when the momentum of
such enthusiasm remained without its motive power, and its transcendence
without its inspiration in real experience, idealism ceased to be an
idealisation, an interpretation of reality reaching prophetically to its
goals. It became a super-numerary second physics, a world to which an
existence was attributed which could be hardly conceived and was
certainly supported by no evidence, while that significance which it
really possessed in reference to natural processes was ignored, or even
denied. An idealism which had consisted in understanding and
discriminating values now became a superstition incapable of discerning
existences. It added a prodigious fictitious setting to the cosmos in
which man had to operate; it obscured his real interests and possible
happiness by seeking to transport him into that unreal environment, with
its fantastic and <a name="Page_135" id="Page_135" />disproportionate economy; and, worst of all, it
robbed the ideal of its ideality by tearing it up from its roots in
natural will and in experienced earthly benefits. For an ideal is not
ideal if it is the ideal of nothing. In that case it is only a ghostly
existence, with no more moral significance or authority in relation to
the observer than has any happy creature which may happen to exist
somewhere in the unknown reaches of the universe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Stoic revision.</div>

<p>Meantime, a second reinterpretation of mythology was attempted by the
Stoics. Instead of moving forward, like Plato, toward the
supernaturalism that was for so many ages to dominate the world, the
Stoics, with greater loyalty to pagan principles, reverted to the
natural forces that had been the chief basis for the traditional
deities. The progress of philosophy had given the Stoics a notion of the
cosmos such as the early Aryan could not have possessed when he recorded
and took to heart his scattered observations in the form of divine
influences, as many and various as the observations themselves. To the
Stoics the world was evidently one dynamic system. The power that
animated it was therefore one God. Accordingly, after explaining away
the popular myths by turning them somewhat ruthlessly into moral
apologues, they proceeded to identify Zeus with the order of nature.
This identification was supported by many traditional tendencies and
philosophic hints. The resulting concept, though still mythical, was
perhaps as ration<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136" />alistic as the state of science at the time could
allow. Zeus had been from the beginning a natural force, at once serene
and formidable, the thunderer no less than the spirit of the blue. He
was the ruler of gods and men; he was, under limitations, a sort of
general providence. Anaxagoras, too, in proclaiming the cosmic function
of reason, had prepared the way for the Stoics in another direction.
This &quot;reason,&quot; which in Socrates and Plato was already a deity, meant an
order, an order making for the good. It was the name for a principle
much like that which Aristotle called Nature, an indwelling prophetic
instinct by which things strive after their perfection and happiness.
Now Aristotle observed this instinct, as behoved a disciple of Socrates,
in its specific cases, in which the good secured could be discriminated
and visibly attained. There were many souls, each with its provident
function and immutable guiding ideal, one for each man and animal, one
for each heavenly sphere, and one, the prime mover, for the highest
sphere of all. But the Stoics, not trained in the same humane and
critical school, had felt the unity, of things more dramatically and
vaguely in the realm of physics. Like Xenophanes of old, they gazed at
the broad sky and exclaimed, &quot;The All is One.&quot; Uniting these various
influences, they found it easy to frame a conception of Zeus, or the
world, or the universal justice and law, so as to combine in it a
dynamic unity with a provident reason. A world conceived to be material
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137" />and fatally determined was endowed with foresight of its own changes,
perfect internal harmony, and absolute moral dignity. Thus mythology,
with the Stoics, ended in pantheism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ideal surrendered before the physical.</div>

<p>By reducing their gods to a single divine influence, and identifying
this in turn with natural forces, the Stoics had, in one sense, saved
mythology. For no one would be inclined to deny existence or power to
the cosmos, to the body the soul of which was Zeus. Pantheism, taken
theoretically, is only naturalism poetically expressed. It therefore was
a most legitimate and congenial interpretation of paganism for a
rationalistic age. On the other hand, mythology had not been a mere
poetic physics; it had formulated the object of religion; it had
embodied for mankind its highest ideals in worshipful forms. It was when
this religious function was transferred to the god of pantheism that the
paradox and impossibility of the reform became evident. Nature neither
is nor can be man's ideal. The substitution of nature for the
traditional and ideal object of religion involves giving nature moral
authority over man; it involves that element of Stoicism which is the
synonym of inhumanity. Life and death, good and ill fortune, happiness
and misery, since they flow equally from the universal order, shall be
declared, in spite of reason, to be equally good. True virtue shall be
reduced to conformity. He who has no ideal but that nature should
possess her actual <a name="Page_138" id="Page_138" />constitution will be wise and superior to all
flattery and calamity; he will be equal in dignity to Zeus. He who has
any less conformable and more determinate interests will be a fool and a
worm.</p>

<p>The wise man will, meantime, perform all the offices of nature; he will
lend his body and his mind to her predestined labours. For pantheistic
morals, though post-rational, are not ascetic. In dislodging the natural
ideal from the mind, they put in its place not its supernatural
exaggeration but a curtailment of it inspired by despair. The passions
are not renounced on the ground that they impede salvation or some
visionary ecstasy; they are merely chilled by the sense that their
defeat, when actual, is also desirable. As all the gods have been
reduced to one substance or law, so all human treasures are reduced to
one privilege&mdash;that of fortitude. You can always consent, and by a
forced and perpetual conformity to nature lift yourself above all
vicissitudes. Those tender and tentative ideals which nature really
breeds, and which fill her with imperfect but genuine excellences, you
will be too stolid to perceive or too proud to share.</p>

<p>Thus the hereditary taint of mythology, the poison of lies, survived in
the two forms of philosophic paganism which it concerns us to study. In
Plato's school, myth helped to hypostasise the ideas and, by divorcing
them from their natural basis, to deprive them of their significance and
moral function, and render the worship of them <a name="Page_139" id="Page_139" />superstitious. In the
Stoa the surviving mythological element turned nature, when her unity
and order had been perceived, into an idol; so that the worship of her
blasted all humane and plastic ideals and set men upon a vain and
fanatical self-denial. Both philosophies were post-rational, as befitted
a decadent age and as their rival and heir, Christianity, was also.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parallel movements in Christianity.</div>

<p>Christianity had already within itself a similar duality; being a
doctrine of redemption, like neo-Platonism, it tended to deny the
natural values of this life; but, being a doctrine of creation and
providential government, comparable in a way to the Stoic, it had an
ineradicable inward tendency toward pantheism, and toward a consequent
acceptance of both the goods and evils of this world as sanctioned and
required by providence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hebraism, if philosophical, must be pantheistic.</div>

<p>The horror which pantheism has always inspired in the Church is like
that which materialism inspires in sentimental idealists; they attack it
continually, not so much because anybody else defends it as because they
feel it to be implied unmistakably in half their own tenets. The
non-Platonic half of Christian theology, the Mosaic half, is bound to
become pantheism in the hands of a philosopher. The Jews were not
pantheists themselves, because they never speculated on the relation
which omnipotence stood in to natural forces and human acts. They
conceived Jehovah's omnipotence dramatically, as <a name="Page_140" id="Page_140" />they conceived
everything. He might pounce upon anything and anybody; he might subvert
or play with the laws of nature; he might laugh at men's devices, and
turn them to his own ends; his craft and energy could not but succeed in
every instance; but that was not to say that men and nature had no will
of their own, and did not proceed naturally on their respective ways
when Jehovah happened to be busy elsewhere. So soon, however, as this
dramatic sort of omnipotence was made systematic by dialectic, so soon
as the doctrines of creation, omniscience, and providential government
were taken absolutely, pantheism was clearly involved. The consequences
to moral philosophy were truly appalling, for then the sins God punished
so signally were due to his own contrivance. The fervours of his saints,
the fate of his chosen people and holy temples, became nothing but a
puppet-show in his ironical self-consciousness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pantheism, even when psychic, ignores ideals.</div>

<p>The strangest part of this system, or what would seem so if its
antecedents were not known, is that it is only half-conscious of its
physical temper, and in calling itself an idealism (because it makes
perception and will the substance of their objects), thinks itself an
expression of human aspirations. This illusion has deep historical
roots. It is the last stage of a mythical philosophy which has been
earnestly criticising its metaphors, on the assumption that they were
not metaphorical; whereby it has stripped <a name="Page_141" id="Page_141" />them of all significance and
reduced them at last to the bare principle of inversion. Nothing is any
longer idealised, yet all is still called an idealism. A myth is an
inverted image of things, wherein their moral effects are turned into
their dramatic antecedents&mdash;as when the wind's rudeness is turned into
his anger. When the natural basis of moral life is not understood, myth
is the only way of expressing it theoretically, as eyes too weak to see
the sun face to face may, as Plato says, for a time study its image
mirrored in pools, and, as we may add, inverted there. So the good,
which in itself is spiritual only, is transposed into a natural power.
At first this amounts to an amiable misrepresentation of natural things;
the gods inhabit Mount Olympus and the Elysian Fields are not far west
of Cadiz. With the advance of geography the mythical facts recede, and
in a cosmography like Hegel's, for instance, they have disappeared
altogether; but there remain the mythical values once ascribed to those
ideal objects but now transferred and fettered to the sad realities that
have appeared in their place. The titles of honour once bestowed on a
fabled world are thus applied to the real world by right of inheritance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Truly divine action limited to what makes for the good.</div>

<p>Nothing could be clearer than the grounds on which pious men in the
beginning recognise divine agencies. We see, they say, the hand of God
in our lives. He has saved us from dangers, he has comforted us in
sorrow. He has blessed us with the <a name="Page_142" id="Page_142" />treasures of life, of intelligence,
of affection. He has set around us a beautiful world, and one still more
beautiful within us. Pondering all these blessings, we are convinced
that he is mighty in the world and will know how to make all things good
to those who trust in him. In other words, pious men discern God in the
excellence of things. If all were well, as they hope it may some day be,
God would henceforth be present in everything. While good is mixed with
evil, he is active in the good alone. The pleasantness of life, the
preciousness of human possessions, the beauty and promise of the world,
are proof of God's power; so is the stilling of tempests and the
forgiveness of sins. But the sin itself and the tempest, which
optimistic theology has to attribute just as much to God's purposes, are
not attributed to him at all by pious feeling, but rather to his
enemies. In spite of centuries wasted in preaching God's omnipotence,
his omnipotence is contradicted by every Christian judgment and every
Christian prayer. If the most pious of nations is engaged in war, and
suffers a great accidental disaster, such as it might expect to be safe
from, <i>Te deums</i> are sung for those that were saved and <i>Requiems</i> for
those that perished. God's office, in both cases, is to save only. No
one seriously imagines that Providence does more than <i>govern</i>&mdash;that is,
watch over and incidentally modify the natural course of affairs&mdash;not
even in the other world, if fortunes are still changeable there.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143" />Need of an opposing principle.</div>

<p>The criterion of divine activity could not be placed more squarely and
unequivocally in the good. Plato and Aristotle are not in this respect
better moralists than is an unsophisticated piety. God is the ideal, and
what manifests the ideal manifests God. Are you confident of the
permanence and triumph of the things you prize? Then you trust in God,
you live in the consciousness of his presence. The proof and measure of
rationality in the world, and of God's power over it, is the extent of
human satisfactions. In hell, good people would disbelieve in God, and
it is impious of the trembling devils to believe in him there. The
existence of any evil&mdash;and if evil is felt it exists, for experience is
its locus&mdash;is a proof that some accident has intruded into God's works.
If that loyalty to the good, which is the prerequisite of rationality,
is to remain standing, we must admit into the world, while it contains
anything practically evil, a principle, however minimised, which is not
rational. This irrational principle may be inertia in matter, accidental
perversity in the will, or ultimate conflict of interests. Somehow an
element of resistance to the rational order must be introduced
somewhere. And immediately, in order to distinguish the part furnished
by reason from its irrational alloy, we must find some practical test;
for if we are to show that there is a great and triumphant rationality
in the world, in spite of irrational accidents and brute opposition, we
must <a name="Page_144" id="Page_144" />frame an idea of rationality different from that of being. It will
no longer do to say, with the optimists, the rational is the real, the
real is the rational. For we wish to make a distinction, in order to
maintain our loyalty to the good, and not to eviscerate the idea of
reason by emptying it of its essential meaning, which is action
addressed to the good and thought envisaging the ideal. To pious
feeling, the free-will of creatures, their power, active or passive, of
independent origination, is the explanation of all defects; and
everything which is not helpful to men's purposes must be assigned to
their own irrationality as its cause. Herein lies the explanation of
that paradox in religious feeling which attributes sin to the free will,
but repentance and every good work to divine grace. Physically
considered&mdash;as theology must consider the matter&mdash;both acts and both
volitions are equally necessary and involved in the universal order; but
practical religion calls divine only what makes for the good. Whence it
follows at once that, both within and without us, what is done well is
God's doing, and what is done ill is not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The standard of value is human.</div>

<p>Thus what we may call the practical or Hebrew theory of cosmic
rationality betrays in plainest possible manner that reason is primarily
a function of human nature. Reason dwells in the world in so far as the
world is good, and the world is good in so far as it supports the wills
it generates&mdash;the excellence <a name="Page_145" id="Page_145" />of each creature, the value of its life,
and the satisfaction of its ultimate desires. Thus Hebrew optimism could
be moral because, although it asserted in a sense the morality of the
universe, it asserted this only by virtue of a belief that the universe
supported human ideals. Undoubtedly much insistence on the greatness of
that power which made for righteousness was in danger of passing over
into idolatry of greatness and power, for whatever they may make. Yet
these relapses into Nature-worship are the more rare in that the Jews
were not a speculative people, and had in the end to endow even Job with
his worldly goods in order to rationalise his constancy. It was only by
a scandalous heresy that Spinoza could so change the idea of God as to
make him indifferent to his creatures; and this transformation, in spite
of the mystic and stoical piety of its author, passed very justly for
atheism; for that divine government and policy had been denied by which
alone God was made manifest to the Hebrews.</p>

<p>If Job's reward seems to us unworthy, we must remember that we have
since passed through the discipline of an extreme moral idealism,
through a religion of sacrifice and sorrow. We should not confuse the
principle that virtue must somehow secure the highest good (for what
should not secure it would not be virtue) with the gross symbols by
which the highest good might be expressed at Jerusalem. That Job should
recover a thousand she-asses may seem to us a poor sop for his long
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146" />anguish of mind and body, and we may hardly agree with him in finding
his new set of children just as good as the old. Yet if fidelity had led
to no good end, if it had not somehow brought happiness to somebody,
that fidelity would have been folly. There is a noble folly which
consists in pushing a principle usually beneficent to such lengths as to
render it pernicious; and the pertinacity of Job would have been a case
of such noble folly if we were not somehow assured of its ultimate
fruits. In Christianity we have the same principle, save that the fruits
of virtue are more spiritually conceived; they are inward peace, the
silence of the passions, the possession of truth, and the love of God
and of our fellows. This is a different conception of happiness,
incomplete, perhaps, in a different direction. But were even this
attenuated happiness impossible to realise, all rationality would vanish
not merely from Christian charity and discipline, but from the whole
Christian theory of creation, redemption, and judgment. Without some
window open to heaven, religion would be more fantastic than worldliness
without being less irrational and vain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hope for happiness makes belief in God.</div>

<p>Revelation has intervened to bring about a conception of the highest
good which never could have been derived from an impartial synthesis of
human interests. The influence of great personalities and the fanaticism
of peculiar times and races have joined in imposing such variations from
the natural ideal. The rationality of the world, <a name="Page_147" id="Page_147" />as Christianity
conceived it, is due to the plan of salvation; and the satisfaction of
human nature, however purified and developed, is what salvation means.
If an ascetic ideal could for a moment seem acceptable, it was because
the decadence and sophistication of the world had produced a great
despair in all noble minds; and they thought it better that an eye or a
hand which had offended should perish, and that they should enter blind
and maimed into the kingdom of heaven, than that, whole and seeing, they
should remain for ever in hell-fire. Supernatural, then, as the ideal
might seem, and imposed on human nature from above, it was yet accepted
only because nothing else, in that state of conscience and imagination,
could revive hope; nothing else seemed to offer an escape from the
heart's corruption and weariness into a new existence.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>THE CHRISTIAN COMPROMISE</p>


<p>The human spirit has not passed in historical times through a more
critical situation or a greater revulsion than that involved in
accepting Christianity. Was this event favourable to the life of Reason?
Was it a progress in competence, understanding, and happiness? Any
absolute answer would be misleading. Christianity did not come to
destroy; the ancient springs were dry already, and for two or three
centuries unmistakable signs of decadence had appeared in every sphere,
not least in that of religion and philosophy. Christianity was a
reconstruction out of ruins. In the new world competence could only be
indirect, understanding mythical, happiness surreptitious; but all three
subsisted, and it was Christianity that gave them their necessary
disguises.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suspense between hope and disillusion.</div>

<p>The young West had failed in its first great experiment, for, though
classic virtue and beauty and a great classic state subsisted, the force
that had created them was spent. Was it possible to try again? Was it
necessary to sit down, like the Orient, in perpetual flux and eternal
apathy? This question was an<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149" />swered by Christianity in a way, under the
circumstances, extremely happy. The Gospel, on which Christianity was
founded, had drawn a very sharp contrast between this world and the
kingdom of heaven&mdash;a phrase admitting many interpretations. From the
Jewish millennium or a celestial paradise it could shift its sense to
mean the invisible Church, or even the inner life of each mystical
spirit. Platonic philosophy, to which patristic theology was allied, had
made a contrast not less extreme between sense and spirit, between life
in time and absorption in eternity. Armed with this double dualism,
Christianity could preach both renunciation and hope, both asceticism
and action, both the misery of life and the blessing of creation. It
even enshrined the two attitudes in its dogma, uniting the Jewish
doctrine of a divine Creator and Governor of this world with that of a
divine Redeemer to lead us into another. Persons were not lacking to
perceive the contradiction inherent in such an eclecticism; and it was
the Gnostic or neo-Platonic party, which denied creation and taught a
pure asceticism, that had the best of the argument. The West, however,
would not yield to their logic. It might, in an hour of trouble and
weakness, make concessions to quietism and accept the cross, but it
would not suffer the naturalistic note to die out altogether. It
preferred an inconsistency, which it hardly perceived, to a complete
surrender of its instincts. It settled down to the conviction that God
created the world <i>and</i> <a name="Page_150" id="Page_150" />redeemed it; that the soul is naturally good
<i>and</i> needs salvation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superficial solution.</div>

<p>This contradiction can be explained exoterically by saying that time and
changed circumstances separate the two situations: having made the world
perfect, God redeems it after it has become corrupt; and whereas all
things are naturally good, they may by accident lose their excellence,
and need to have it restored. There is, however, an esoteric side to the
matter. A soul that may be redeemed, a will that may look forward to a
situation in which its action will not be vain or sinful, is one that in
truth has never sinned; it has merely been thwarted. Its ambition is
rational, and what its heart desires is essentially good and ideal. So
that the whole classic attitude, the faith in action, art, and
intellect, is preserved under this protecting cuticle of dogma; nothing
was needed but a little courage, and circumstances somewhat more
favourable, for the natural man to assert himself again. A people
believing in the resurrection of the flesh in heaven will not be averse
to a reawakening of the mind on earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But from what shall we be redeemed?</div>

<p>Another pitfall, however, opens here. These contrasted doctrines may
change r&ocirc;les. So long as by redemption we understand, in the mystic way,
exaltation above finitude and existence, because all particularity is
sin, to be redeemed is to abandon the Life of Reason; but redemption
might mean extrication from untoward accidents, so that a rational life
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151" />might be led under right conditions. Instead of being like Buddha, the
redeemer might be like Prometheus. In that case, however, the creator
would become like Zeus&mdash;a tyrant will responsible for our conditions
rather than expressive of our ideal. The doctrine of creation would
become pantheism and that of redemption, formerly ascetic, would
represent struggling humanity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Typical attitude of St. Augustine.</div>

<p>The seething of these potent and ambiguous elements can be studied
nowhere better than in Saint Augustine. He is a more genial and complete
representative of Christianity than any of the Greek Fathers, in whom
the Hebraic and Roman vitality was comparatively absent. Philosophy was
only one phase of Augustine's genius; with him it was an instrument of
zeal and a stepping-stone to salvation. Scarcely had it been born out of
rhetoric when it was smothered in authority. Yet even in that precarious
and episodic form it acquired a wonderful sweep, depth, and technical
elaboration. He stands at the watershed of history, looking over either
land; his invectives teach us almost as much of paganism and heresy as
his exhortations do of Catholicism. To Greek subtlety he joins Hebrew
fervour and monkish intolerance; he has a Latin amplitude and (it must
be confessed) coarseness of feeling; but above all he is the illumined,
enraptured, forgiven saint. In him theology, however speculative,
remains a vehicle for living piety; and while he has, perhaps, done more
than any <a name="Page_152" id="Page_152" />other man to materialise Christianity, no one was ever more
truly filled with its spirit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He achieves Platonism.</div>

<p>Saint Augustine was a thorough Platonist, but to reach that position he
had to pass in his youth through severe mental struggles. The difficult
triumph over the sensuous imagination by which he attained the
conception of intelligible objects was won only after long discipline
and much reading of Platonising philosophers. Every reality seemed to
him at first an object of sense: God, if he existed, must be
perceptible, for to Saint Augustine's mind also, at this early and
sensuous stage of its development, <i>esse</i> was <i>percipi</i>. He might never
have worked himself loose from these limitations, with which his vivid
fancy and not too delicate eloquence might easily have been satisfied,
had it not been for his preoccupation with theology. God must somehow be
conceived; for no one in that age of religious need and of theological
passion felt both more intensely than Saint Augustine. If sensible
objects alone were real, God must be somewhere discoverable in space; he
must either have a body like the human, or be the body of the universe,
or some subtler body permeating and moving all the rest.</p>

<p>These conceptions all offered serious dialectical difficulties, and,
what was more to the point, they did not satisfy the religious and
idealistic instinct which the whole movement of Saint Augustine's mind
obeyed. So he pressed his inquiries farther. At length meditation, and
more, perhaps, that <a name="Page_153" id="Page_153" />experience of the flux and vanity of natural things
on which Plato himself had built his heaven of ideas, persuaded him that
reality and substantiality, in any eulogistic sense, must belong rather
to the imperceptible and eternal. Only that which is never an object of
sense or experience can be the root and principle of experience and
sense. Only the invisible and changeless can be the substance of a
moving show. God could now be apprehended and believed in precisely
because he was essentially invisible: had he anywhere appeared he could
not be the principle of all appearance; had he had a body and a <i>locus</i>
in the universe, he could not have been its spiritual creator. The
ultimate objects of human knowledge were accordingly ideas, not things;
principles reached by the intellect, not objects by any possibility
offered to sense. The methodological concepts of science, by which we
pass from fact to fact and from past perception to future, did not
attract Augustine's attention. He admitted, it is true, that there was a
subordinate, and to him apparently uninteresting, region governed by
&quot;<i>certissima ratione vel experientia</i>,&quot; and he even wished science to be
allowed a free hand within that empirical and logical sphere. A mystic
and allegorical interpretation of Scripture was to be invoked to avoid
the puerilities into which any literal interpretation&mdash;of the creation
in six days, for instance&mdash;would be sure to run. Unbelievers would thus
not be scandalised by mythical dogmas &quot;concerning things which they
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154" />might have actually experienced, or discovered by sure calculation.&quot;</p>

<p>Science was to have its way in the field of calculable experience; that
region could be the more readily surrendered by Augustine because his
attention was henceforth held by those ideal objects which he had so
laboriously come to conceive. These were concepts of the contemplative
reason or imagination, which envisages natures and eternal essences
behind the variations of experience, essences which at first receive
names, becoming thus the centres of rational discourse, then acquire
values, becoming guides to action and measures of achievement, and
finally attract unconditional worship, being regarded as the first
causes and ultimate goals of all existence and aspiration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He identifies it with Christianity.</div>

<p>This purely Platonic philosophy, however, was not to stand alone. Like
every phase of Saint Augustine's speculation, it came, as we have said,
to buttress or express some religious belief. But it is a proof of his
depth and purity of soul that his searching philosophic intuition did
more to spiritualise the dogmas he accepted from others than these
dogmas could do to denaturalise his spontaneous philosophy. Platonic
ideas had by that time long lost their moral and representative value,
their Socratic significance. They had become ontological entities,
whereas originally they had represented the rational functions of life.
This hypostasis of the rational, by which the rational <a name="Page_155" id="Page_155" />abdicates its
meaning in the effort to acquire a metaphysical existence, had already
been carried to its extreme by the Neo-Platonists. But Saint Augustine,
while helpless as a philosopher to resist that speculative realism, was
able as a Christian to infuse into those dead concepts some of the human
blood which had originally quickened them. Metaphysics had turned all
human interests into mythical beings, and now religion, without at all
condemning or understanding that transformation, was going to adopt
those mythical beings and turn them again into moral influences. In
Saint Augustine's mind, fed as it was by the Psalmist, the Platonic
figments became the Christian God, the Christian Church, and the
Christian soul, and thus acquired an even subtler moral fragrance than
that which they had lost when they were uprooted by a visionary
philosophy from the soil of Greek culture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">God the good.</div>

<p>Saint Augustine's way of conceiving God is an excellent illustration of
the power, inherent in his religious genius and sincerity, of giving
life and validity to ideas which he was obliged to borrow in part from a
fabulous tradition and in part from a petrified metaphysics. God, to
him, was simply the ideal eternal object of human thought and love. All
ideation on an intellectual plane was a vague perception of the divine
essence. &quot;The rational soul understands God, for it understands what
exists always unchanged.&quot; ... &quot;God is happiness; and in him <a name="Page_156" id="Page_156" />and from
him and through him all things are happy which are happy at all. God is
the good and the beautiful.&quot; He was never tired of telling us that God
is not true but the truth <i>(i.e.</i>, the ideal object of thought in any
sphere), not good but the good <i>(i.e.</i>, the ideal object of will in all
its rational manifestations). In other words, whenever a man, reflecting
on his experience, conceived the better or the best, the perfect and the
eternal, he conceived God, inadequately, of course, yet essentially,
because God signified the comprehensive ideal of all the perfections
which the human spirit could behold in itself or in its objects. Of this
divine essence, accordingly, every interesting thing was a
manifestation; all virtue and beauty were parcels of it, tokens of its
superabundant grace. Hence the inexhaustible passion of Saint Augustine
toward his God; hence the sweetness of that endless colloquy in prayer
into which he was continually relapsing, a passion and a sweetness which
no one will understand to whom God is primarily a natural power and only
accidentally a moral ideal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Primary and secondary religion.</div>

<p>Herein lies the chief difference between those in whom religion is
spontaneous and primary&mdash;a very few&mdash;those in whom it is imitative and
secondary. To the former, divine things are inward values, projected by
chance into images furnished by poetic tradition or by external nature,
while to the latter, divine things are in the first instance objective
factors of nature or of social tradition, although they have <a name="Page_157" id="Page_157" />come,
perhaps, to possess some point of contact with the interests of the
inner life on account of the supposed physical influence which those
super-human entities have over human fortunes. In a word, theology, for
those whose religion is secondary, is simply a false physics, a doctrine
about eventual experience not founded on the experience of the past.
Such a false physics, however, is soon discredited by events; it does
not require much experience or much shrewdness to discover that
supernatural beings and laws are without the empirical efficacy which
was attributed to them. True physics and true history must always tend,
in enlightened minds, to supplant those misinterpreted religious
traditions. Therefore, those whose reflection or sentiment does not
furnish them with a key to the moral symbolism and poetic validity
underlying theological ideas, if they apply their intelligence to the
subject at all, and care to be sincere, will very soon come to regard
religion as a delusion. Where religion is primary, however, all that
worldly dread of fraud and illusion becomes irrelevant, as it is
irrelevant to an artist's pleasure to be warned that the beauty he
expresses has no objective existence, or as it would be irrelevant to a
mathematician's reasoning to suspect that Pythagoras was a myth and his
supposed philosophy an abracadabra. To the religious man religion is
inwardly justified. God has no need of natural or logical witnesses, but
speaks himself within the heart, being indeed that ineffable attraction
which <a name="Page_158" id="Page_158" />dwells in whatever is good and beautiful, and that persuasive
visitation of the soul by the eternal and incorruptible by which she
feels herself purified, rescued from mortality, and given an inheritance
in the truth. This is precisely what Saint Augustine knew and felt with
remarkable clearness and persistence, and what he expressed unmistakably
by saying that every intellectual perception is knowledge of God or has
God's nature for its object.</p>

<p>Proofs of the existence of God are therefore not needed, since his
existence is in one sense obvious and in another of no religious
interest. It is obvious in the sense that the ideal is a term of moral
experience, and that truth, goodness, and beauty are inevitably
envisaged by any one whose life has in some measure a rational quality.
It is of no religious interest in the sense that perhaps some physical
or dynamic absolute might be scientifically discoverable in the dark
entrails of nature or of mind. The great difference between religion and
metaphysics is that religion looks for God at the top of life and
metaphysics at the bottom; a fact which explains why metaphysics has
such difficulty in finding God, while religion has never lost him.</p>

<p>This brings us to the grand characteristic and contradiction of Saint
Augustine's philosophy, a characteristic which can be best studied,
perhaps, in him, although it has been inherited by all Christian
theology and was already present in Stoic and <a name="Page_159" id="Page_159" />Platonic speculation,
when the latter had lost its ethical moorings. This is the idea that the
same God who is the ideal of human aspiration is also the creator of the
universe and its only primary substance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ambiguous efficacy of the good in Plato.</div>

<p>If Plato, when he wrote that fine and profound passage in the sixth book
of the Republic, where he says that the good is the cause of all
intelligence in the mind and of all intelligibility in the object, and
indeed the principle of all essence and existence&mdash;if Plato could have
foreseen what his oracular hyperbole was to breed in the world, we may
well believe that he would have expunged it from his pages with the same
severity with which he banished the poets from his State. In the lips of
Socrates, and at that juncture in the argument of the Republic, those
sentences have a legitimate meaning. The good is the principle of
benefit, and the philosophers who are to rule the state will not be
alienated by their contemplations from practical wisdom, seeing that the
idea of the good&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, of the advantageous, profitable, and
beneficial&mdash;is the highest concept of the whole dialectic, that in
reference to which all other ideas have place and significance. If we
ventured to extend the interpretation of the passage, retaining its
spirit, into fields where we have more knowledge than Plato could have,
we might say that the principle of the good generates essence and
existence, in the sense that all natural organs have functions and
utilities <a name="Page_160" id="Page_160" />by which they establish themselves in the world, and that the
system of these useful functions is the true essence or idea of any
living thing. But the Socratic origin and sense of such a passage as
this, and of others (in the Tim&aelig;us, for instance) allied to it, was soon
lost in the headlong idolatry which took possession of the neo-Platonic
school; and it was through this medium that Saint Augustine received his
Platonic inspiration. The good no longer meant, as it did to Plato, the
principle of benefit everywhere, but it meant the good Being; and this,
for a Christian, could naturally be none other than God; so that the
idea that the good was the creator of all essence and existence now
assumed a marvellously Mosaic significance. Here was one of those bits
of primeval revelation which, it was explained, had survived in the
heathen world. The hypostasis of moral conceptions, then, and of the
idea of the good in particular, led up from the Platonic side to the
doctrine of creation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ambiguous goodness of the creator in Job.</div>

<p>The history of the conception among the Jews was entirely different, the
element of goodness in the creator being there adventitious and the
element of power original. Jehovah for Job was a universal force,
justified primarily by his omnipotence; but this physical authority
would in the end, he hoped, be partly rationalised and made to clash
less scandalously with the authority of justice. Among the Greeks, as
was to be expected, the idea of justice <a name="Page_161" id="Page_161" />was more independent and
entire; but once named and enshrined, that divinity, too, tended to
absoluteness, and could be confused with the physical basis of
existence. In the Stoic philosophy the latter actually gained the upper
hand, and the problem of Job reappeared on the horizon. It did not rise
into painful prominence, however, until Christian times, when absolute
moral perfection and absolute physical efficacy were predicated of God
with equal emphasis, if not among the people who never have conceived
God as either perfectly good or entirely omnipotent, at least among the
theologians. If not all felt the contradiction with equal acuteness, the
reason doubtless was that a large part of their thought was perfunctory
and merely apologetic: they did not quite mean what they said when they
spoke of perfect goodness; and we shall see how Saint Augustine himself,
when reduced to extremities, surrendered his loyalty to the moral ideal
rather than reconsider his traditional premisses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Manicheans.</div>

<p>How tenaciously, however, he clung to the moral in the religious, we can
see by the difficulty he had in separating himself from the Manicheans.
The Manicheans admitted two absolutes, the essence of the one being
goodness and of the other badness. This system was logically weak,
because these absolutes were in the first place two, which is one
contradiction, and in the second place relative, which is another. But
in spite of the pitfalls <a name="Page_162" id="Page_162" />into which the Manicheans were betrayed by
their pursuit of metaphysical absolutes, they were supported by a moral
intuition of great truth and importance. They saw that an essentially
good principle could not have essential evil for its effect. These moral
terms are, we may ourselves feel sure, relative to existence and to
actual impulse, and it may accordingly be always misleading to make them
the essence of metaphysical realities: good and bad may be not
existences but qualities which existences have only in relation to
demands in themselves or in one another. Yet if we once launch, as many
metaphysicians would have us do, into the hypostasis of qualities and
relations, it is certainly better and more honest to make contradictory
qualities into opposed entities, and not to render our metaphysical
world unmeaning as well as fictitious by peopling it with concepts in
which the most important categories of life are submerged and
invalidated. Evil may be no more a metaphysical existence than good is;
both are undoubtedly mere terms for vital utilities and impediments; but
if we are to indulge in mythology at all, it is better that our
mythology should do symbolic justice to experience and should represent
by contrasted figures the ineradicable practical difference between the
better and the worse, the beautiful and the ugly, the trustworthy and
the fallacious. To discriminate between these things in practice is
wisdom, and it should be the part of wisdom to discriminate between them
in theory.</p>

<p><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163" />The Manicheans accordingly attributed what is good in the world to one
power and what is bad to another. The fable is transparent enough, and
we, who have only just learned to smile at a personal devil, may affect
to wonder that any one should ever have taken it literally. But in an
age when the assertive imagination was unchecked by any critical sense,
such a device at least avoided the scandal of attributing all the evils
and sins of this world to a principle essentially inviolate and pure. By
avoiding what must have seemed a blasphemy to Saint Augustine, as to
every one whose speculation was still relevant to his conscience and to
his practical idealism, the Manicheans thus prevailed on many to
overlook the contradictions which their system developed so soon as its
figments were projected into the sphere of absolute existences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All things good by nature.</div>

<p>The horror with which an idealistic youth at first views the truculence
of nature and the turpitude of worldly life is capable of being softened
by experience. Time subdues our initial preferences by showing us the
complexity of moral relations in this world, and by extending our
imaginative sympathy to forms of existence and passion at first
repulsive, which from new and ultra-personal points of view may have
their natural sweetness and value. In this way, Saint Augustine was
ultimately brought to appreciate the catholicity and scope of those
Greek sages who had taught that all being was to <a name="Page_164" id="Page_164" />itself good, that evil
was but the impediment of natural function, and that therefore the
conception of anything totally or essentially evil was only a petulance
or exaggeration in moral judgment that took, as it were, the bit in its
teeth, and turned an incidental conflict of interests into a
metaphysical opposition of natures. All definite being is in itself
congruous with the true and the good, since its constitution is
intelligible and its operation is creative of values. Were it not for
the limitations of matter and the accidental crowding and conflict of
life, all existing natures might subsist and prosper in peace and
concord, just as their various ideas live without contradiction in the
realm of conceptual truth. We may say of all things, in the words of the
Gospel, that their angels see the face of God. Their ideals are no less
cases of the good, no less instances of perfection, than is the ideal
locked in our private bosom. It is the part of justice and charity to
recognise this situation, in view of which we may justly say that evil
is always relative and subordinate to some constituted nature in itself
a standard of worth, a point of departure for the moral valuation of
eventual changes and of surrounding things. Evil is accordingly
accidental and unnatural; it follows upon the maladaptation of actions
to natures and of natures to one another. It can be no just ground for
the condemnation of any of those natural essences which only give rise
to it by their imperfect realisation.</p>

<p><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165" />The Semitic idea of creation could now receive that philosophical
interpretation which it so sadly needed. Primordially, and in respect to
what was positive in them, all things might he expressions of the good;
in their essence and ideal state they might be said to be created by
God. For God was the supreme ideal, to which all other goods were
subordinate and instrumental; and if we agree to make a cosmogony out of
morals and to hypostasise the series of rational ideals, taken in the
inverse order, into a series of efficient causes, it is clear that the
highest good, which is at the end of the moral scale, will now figure as
a first cause at the beginning of the physical sequence. This operation
is what is recorded and demanded in the doctrine of creation: a doctrine
which would lose its dogmatic force if we allowed either the moral
ideality or the physical efficacy of the creator to drop out of sight.
If the moral ideality is sacrificed, we pass to an ordinary pantheism,
while if the physical efficacy is surrendered, we take refuge in a
naturalistic idealism of the Aristotelian type, where the good is a
function of things and neither their substance nor their cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrine of creation demands that of the fall.</div>

<p>To accept the doctrine of creation, after it had become familiar, was
not very hard, because the contradiction it contains could then be set
down to our imperfect apprehension. The unintelligibility of matters of
fact does not lead us to deny them, but merely to study them; and when
the creation was accepted as a fact, its unintelligibility <a name="Page_166" id="Page_166" />became
merely a theological problem and a religious mystery, such as no mortal
philosophy can be without. But for Saint Augustine the situation was
wholly different. A doctrine of the creation had to be constructed: the
disparate ideas had to be synthesised which posterity was afterward to
regard as the obvious, if not wholly reconcilable, attributes of the
deity. The mystery could not then be recognised; it had to be made. And
Saint Augustine, with his vital religion, with his spontaneous adoration
of God the ideal, could not attribute to that ideal unimpeded efficacy
in the world. To admit that all natures were essentially good might
dispel the Manichean fancy about an Evil Absolute engaged in single
combat with an Absolute Good; but insight into the meaning and the
natural conditions of evil could only make its presence more obvious and
its origin more intimately bound up with the general constitution of the
world. Evil is only imperfection; but everything is imperfect. Conflict
is only maladaptation, but there is maladaptation everywhere. If we
assume, then, what the doctrine of creation requires, that all things at
first proceeded out of the potency of the good&mdash;their matter and form,
their distribution and their energies, being wholly attributable to the
attraction of the ultimately best&mdash;it is clear that some calamity must
have immediately supervened by which the fountains of life were defiled,
the strength of the ideal principle in living things <a name="Page_167" id="Page_167" />weakened, and the
mortal conflict instituted which not only condemns all existent things
ultimately to perish, but hardly allows them, even while they painfully
endure, to be truly and adequately themselves.</p>

<p>Original sin, with the fall of the angels and of man for its mythical
ground, thus enters into the inmost web of Augustinian philosophy. This
fact cannot be too much insisted upon, for only by the immediate
introduction of original sin into the history of the world could a man
to whom God was still a moral term believe at all in the natural and
fundamental efficacy of God in the cosmos. The doctrine of the fall made
it possible for Saint Augustine to accept the doctrine of the creation.
Both belonged to the same mythical region in which the moral values of
life were made to figure as metaphysical agents; but when once the
metaphysical agency of the highest good was admitted into a poetic
cosmogony, it became imperative to admit also the metaphysical agency of
sin into it; for otherwise the highest good would be deprived of its
ideal and moral character, would cease to be the entelechy of rational
life, and be degraded into a flat principle of description or synthesis
for experience and nature as they actually are. God would thus become a
natural agent, like the fire of Heraclitus, in which human piety could
take an interest only by force of traditional inertia and
unintelligence, while the continued muttering of the ritual prevented
men from awaking to the dis<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168" />appearance of the god. The essence of deity,
as Augustine was inwardly convinced, was correspondence to human
aspiration, moral perfection, and ideality. God, therefore, as the
Manicheans, with Plato and Aristotle before them, had taught, could be
the author of good only; or, to express the same thing in less
figurative and misleading language, it was only the good in things that
could contribute to our idea of divinity. What was evil must, therefore,
be carried up into another concept, must be referred, if you will, to
another mythical agent; and this mythical agent in Saint Augustine's
theology was named sin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Original sin.</div>

<p>Everything in the world which obscured the image of the creator or
rebelled against his commandments (everything, that is, which prevented
in things the expression of their natural ideals) was due to sin. Sin
was responsible for disease of mind and body, for all suffering, for
death, for ignorance, perversity, and dulness. Sin was responsible&mdash;so
truly <i>original</i> was it&mdash;for what was painful and wrong even in the
animal kingdom, and sin&mdash;such was the paradoxical apex of this inverted
series of causes&mdash;sin was responsible for sin itself. The insoluble
problems of the origin of evil and of freedom, in a world produced in
its every fibre by omnipotent goodness, can never be understood until we
remember their origin. They are artificial problems, unknown to
philosophy before it betook itself to the literal justification of
fables in which the ob<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169" />jects of rational endeavour were represented as
causes of natural existence. The former are internal products of life,
the latter its external conditions. When the two are confused we reach
the contradiction confronting Saint Augustine, and all who to this day
have followed in his steps. The cause of everything must have been the
cause of sin, yet the principle of good could not be the principle of
evil. Both propositions were obviously true, and they were contradictory
only after the mythical identification of the God which meant the ideal
of life with the God which meant the forces of nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forced abandonment of the ideal.</div>

<p>It would help us little, in trying to understand these doctrines, to
work over the dialectic of them, and to express the contradiction in
somewhat veiled terms or according to new pictorial analogies. Good and
evil, in the context of life, undoubtedly have common causes; but that
system which involves both is for that very reason not an ideal system,
and to represent it as such is simply to ignore the conscience and the
upward effort of life. The contradiction can be avoided only by
renouncing the meaning of one of the terms; either, that is, by no
longer regarding the good as an absolute creator, but merely as a
partial result or tendency in a living world whose life naturally
involves values, or else by no longer conceiving God as the ideal term
in man's own existence. The latter is the solution adopted by
metaphysicians generally, and <a name="Page_170" id="Page_170" />by Saint Augustine himself when hard
pressed by the exigencies of his double allegiance. God, he tells us, is
just, although not just as man is, <i>nor as man should be</i>. In other
words, God is to be called just even when he is unjust in the only sense
in which the word justice has a meaning among men. We are forced, in
fact, to obscure our moral concepts and make them equivocal in order to
be able to apply them to the efficient forces and actual habits of this
world. The essence of divinity is no longer moral excellence, but
ontological and dynamic relations to the natural world, so that the love
of God would have to become, not an exercise of reason and conscience,
as it naturally was with Saint Augustine, but a mystical intoxication,
as it was with Spinoza.</p>

<p>The sad effects of this degradation of God into a physical power are not
hard to trace in Augustine's own doctrine and feeling. He became a
champion of arbitrary grace and arbitrary predestination to perdition.
The eternal damnation of innocents gave him no qualms; and in this we
must admire the strength of his logic, since if it is right that there
should be wrong at all, there is no particular reason for stickling at
the quantity or the enormity of it. And yet there are sentences which
for their brutality and sycophancy cannot be read without
pain&mdash;sentences inspired by this misguided desire to apologise for the
crimes of the universe. &quot;Why should God not create beings that he
foreknew were to sin, when indeed in their persons and by <a name="Page_171" id="Page_171" />their fates
he could manifest both what punishment their guilt deserved and what
free gifts he might bestow on them by his favour?&quot; &quot;Thinking it more
lordly and better to do well even in the presence of evil than not to
allow evil to exist at all.&quot; Here the pitiful maxim of doing evil that
good may come is robbed of the excuse it finds in human limitations and
is made the first principle of divine morality. Repellent and contorted
as these ultimate metaphysical theories may seem, we must not suppose
that they destroyed in Saint Augustine that practical and devotional
idealism which they contradicted: the region of Christian charity is
fortunately far wider and far nearer home than that of Christian
apologetics. The work of practical redemption went on, while the
dialectics about the perfection of the universe were forgotten; and
Saint Augustine never ceased, by a happy inconsistency, to bewail the
sins and to combat the heresies which his God was stealthily nursing, so
that in their melodramatic punishment his glory might be more
beautifully manifested.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The problem among the protestants.</div>

<p>It was Saint Augustine, as we know, who, in spite of his fervid
Catholicism, was the favourite master of both Luther and Calvin. They
emphasised, however, his more fanatical side, and this very
predestinarian and absolutist doctrine which he had prevailed on himself
to accept. Here was the pantheistic leaven doing its work; and
concentration of attention on the Old Testament, given the re<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172" />formers'
controversial and metaphysical habit of thought, could only precipitate
the inevitable. While popular piety bubbled up into all sorts of
emotional and captious sects, each with its pathetic insistence on some
text or on some whimsey, but all inwardly inspired by an earnest
religious hunger, academic and cultivated Protestantism became every day
more pale and rationalistic. Mediocre natures continued to rehearse the
old platitudes and tread the slippery middle courses of one orthodoxy or
another; but distinguished minds could no longer treat such survivals as
more than allegories, historic or mythical illustrations of general
spiritual truths. So Lessing, Goethe, and the idealists in Germany, and
after them such lay prophets as Carlyle and Emerson, had for
Christianity only an inessential respect. They drank their genuine
inspiration directly from nature, from history, from the total personal
apprehension they might have of life. In them speculative theology
rediscovered its affinity to neo-Platonism; in other words, Christian
philosophy was washed clean of its legendary alloy to become a pure
cosmic speculation. It was Gnosticism come again in a very different age
to men in an opposite phase of culture, but with its logic unchanged.
The creation was the self-diremption of the infinite into finite
expression, the fall was the self-discovery of this finitude, the
incarnation was the awakening of the finite to its essential infinity;
and here, a sufficient number of pages having been <a name="Page_173" id="Page_173" />engrossed, the
matter generally hastened to a conclusion; for the redemption with its
means of application, once the central point in Christianity, was less
pliable to the new pantheistic interpretation. Neo-Platonism had indeed
cultivated asceticism, ecstasies, and a hope of reabsorption into the
One; but these things a modern, and especially a Teutonic, temperament
could hardly relish; and though absolutism in a sense must
discountenance all finite interests and dissolve all experience, in
theory, into a neutral whole, yet this inevitable mysticism remained, as
with the Stoics, sternly optimistic, in order to respond to the vital
social forces which Protestantism embodied. The ethical part of
neo-Platonism and the corresponding Christian doctrine of salvation had
accordingly to be discarded; for mystical as the northern soul may
gladly be in speculation, to satisfy its sentimentality, it hardly can
be mystical in action, since it has to satisfy also its interest in
success and its fidelity to instinct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pantheism accepted.</div>

<p>An absolutism which thus encourages and sanctions the natural will is
Stoical and pantheistic; it does not, like Indian and Platonic
absolutism, seek to suspend the will in view of some supernatural
destiny. Pantheism subordinates morally what it finds to be dependent in
existence; its religion bids human reason and interest abdicate before
cosmic forces, instead of standing out, like Buddhism and Christianity,
for salvation, for spiritual extrication, from a world which they
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174" />regard as delusive and fallen. The world of German absolutism, like the
Stoic world, was not fallen. On the contrary, it was divinely inspired
and altogether authoritative; he alone who did not find his place and
function in it was unholy and perverse. This world-worship, despising
heartily every finite and rational ideal, gives to impulse and fact,
whatever they may be, liberty to flourish under a divine warrant. Were
the people accepting such a system corrupt, it would sanction their
corruption, and thereby, most probably, lead to its own abandonment, for
it would bring on an ascetic and supernaturalistic reaction by which its
convenient sycophancy would be repudiated. But reflection and piety,
even if their object be material and their worship idolatrous, exalt the
mind and raise it above vulgar impulse. If you fetch from contemplation
a theoretic license to be base, your contemplative habit itself will
have purified you more than your doctrine will have power to degrade you
afresh, for training affects instinct much more than opinion can.
Antinomian theory can flourish blamelessly in a puritan soil, for there
it instinctively remains theoretical. And the Teutonic pantheists are
for the most part uncontaminated souls, puritan by training, and only
interested in furthering the political and intellectual efficiency of
the society in which they live. Their pantheism under these
circumstances makes them the more energetic and turns them into
prac<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175" />tical positivists, docile to their social medium and apologists for
all its conventions. So that, while they write books to disprove
naturalism in natural philosophy where it belongs, in morals where
naturalism is treason they are themselves naturalists of the most
uncritical description, forgetting that only the interests of the finite
soul introduce such a thing as good and evil into the world, and that
nature and society are so far from being authoritative and divine that
they have no value whatever save by the services they may render to each
spirit in its specific and genuine ambitions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plainer scorn for the ideal.</div>

<p>Indeed, this pantheistic subordination of conscience to what happens to
exist, this optimism annulling every human ideal, betrays its immoral
tendency very clearly so soon as it descends from theological seminaries
into the lay world. Poets at first begin to justify, on its authority,
their favourite passions and to sing the picturesqueness of a
blood-stained world. &quot;Practical&quot; men follow, deprecating any reflection
which may cast a doubt on the providential justification of their chosen
activities, and on the invisible value of the same, however sordid,
brutal, or inane they may visibly be. Finally, politicians learn to
invoke destiny and the movement of the age to save themselves the
trouble of discerning rational ends and to colour their secret
indifference to the world's happiness. The follies thus sanctioned
theoretically, because they are involved in a perfect world, would
doubtless be perpetrated <a name="Page_176" id="Page_176" />none the less by the same persons had they
absorbed in youth a different religion; for conduct is rooted in deep
instincts which affect opinion more than opinion can avail to affect
them in turn. Yet there is an added indignity in not preserving a clear
and honest mind, and in quitting the world without having in some
measure understood and appreciated it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The price of mythology is superstition.</div>

<p>Pantheism is mythical and has, as we have just seen, all the subversive
powers of ordinary superstition. It turns the natural world, man's
stamping-ground and system of opportunities, into a self-justifying and
sacred life; it endows the blameless giant with an inhuman soul and then
worships the monstrous divinity it has fabricated. It thereby encounters
the same dilemma that defeats all mythology when it forgets its merely
poetic office and trespasses upon moral ground. It must either interpret
the natural world faithfully, attributing to the mythical deity the sort
of life that dramatically suits its visible behaviour, or if it
idealises and moralises the spectacle it must renounce the material
reality and efficacy of its gods. Either the cosmic power must cover the
actual goodness and badness in nature impartially, when to worship it
would be idolatrous, or it must cover only the better side of nature,
those aspects of it which support and resemble human virtue. In the
latter case it is human virtue that mythology is formulating in a
dramatic fiction, a human ideal that is being illustrated by <a name="Page_177" id="Page_177" />a poet,
who selects for the purpose certain phases of nature and experience. By
this idealisation the affinity which things often have to man's
interests may be brought out in a striking manner; but their total and
real mechanism is no better represented than that of animals in &AElig;sop's
fables. To detect the divergence it suffices to open the eyes; and while
nature may be rationally admired and cherished for so supporting the
soul, it is her eventual ministry to man that makes her admirable, not
her independent magnitude or antiquity. To worship nature as she really
is, with all her innocent crimes made intentional by our mythology and
her unfathomable constitution turned into a caricature of barbarian
passions, is to subvert the order of values and to falsify natural
philosophy. Yet this dislocation of reason, both in its conceptions and
in its allegiance, is the natural outcome of thinking on mythical lines.
A myth, by turning phenomena into expressions of thought and passion,
teaches man to look for models and goals of action in that external
world where reason can find nothing but instruments and materials.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>PIETY</p>


<div class="sidenote">The core of religion not theoretical.</div>

<p>Hebraism is a striking example of a religion tending to discard
mythology and magic. It was a Hebraising apostle who said that true
religion and undefiled was to visit the fatherless and the widow, and do
other works of mercy. Although a complete religion can hardly remain
without theoretic and ritual expression, we must remember that after all
religion has other aspects less conspicuous, perhaps, than its
mythology, but often more worthy of respect. If religion be, as we have
assumed, an imaginative symbol for the Life of Reason, it should contain
not only symbolic ideas and rites, but also symbolic sentiments and
duties. And so it everywhere does in a notable fashion. Piety and
spirituality are phases of religion no less important than mythology, or
than those metaphysical spectres with which mythology terminates. It is
therefore time we should quite explicitly turn from religious ideas to
religious emotions, from imaginative history and science to imaginative
morals.</p>

<p><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179" />Piety, in its nobler and Roman sense, may be said to mean man's
reverent attachment to the sources of his being and the steadying of his
life by that attachment. A soul is but the last bubble of a long
fermentation in the world. If we wish to live associated with permanent
racial interests we must plant ourselves on a broad historic and human
foundation, we must absorb and interpret the past which has made us, so
that we may hand down its heritage reinforced, if possible, and in no
way undermined or denaturalised. This consciousness that the human
spirit is derived and responsible, that all its functions are heritages
and trusts, involves a sentiment of gratitude and duty which we may call
piety.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loyalty to the sources of our being.</div>

<p>The true objects of piety are, of course, those on which life and its
interests really depend: parents first, then family, ancestors, and
country; finally, humanity at large and the whole natural cosmos. But
had a lay sentiment toward these forces been fostered by clear knowledge
of their nature and relation to ourselves, the dutifulness or cosmic
emotion thereby aroused would have remained purely moral and historical.
As science would not in the end admit any myth which was not avowed
poetry, so it would not admit any piety which was not plain reason and
duty. But man, in his perplexities and pressing needs, has plunged, once
for all, into imaginative courses through which it is our business to
follow him, to see if he may not eventually reach <a name="Page_180" id="Page_180" />his goal even by
those by-paths and dark circumlocutions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The pious &AElig;neas.</div>

<p>What makes piety an integral part of traditional religions is the fact
that moral realities are represented in the popular mind by poetic
symbols. The awe inspired by principles so abstract and consequences so
remote and general is arrested at their conventional name. We have all
read in boyhood, perhaps with derision, about the pious &AElig;neas. His piety
may have seemed to us nothing but a feminine sensibility, a faculty of
shedding tears on slight provocation. But in truth &AElig;neas's piety, as
Virgil or any Roman would have conceived it, lay less in his feelings
than in his function and vocation. He was bearing the Palladium of his
country to a new land, to found another Troy, so that the blood and
traditions of his ancestors might not perish. His emotions were only the
appropriate expression of his priestly office. The hero might have been
stern and stolid enough on his own martial ground, but since he bore the
old Anchises from the ruins of Ilium he had assumed a sacred mission.
Henceforth a sacerdotal unction and lyric pathos belonged rightfully to
his person. If those embers, so religiously guarded, should by chance
have been extinguished, there could never have been a Vestal fire nor
any Rome. So that all that Virgil and his readers, if they had any
piety, revered in the world had been hazarded in those legendary
adventures. It was not &AElig;neas's own life or private <a name="Page_181" id="Page_181" />ambition that was at
stake to justify his emotion. His tenderness, like Virgil's own, was
ennobled and made heroic by its magnificent and impersonal object. It
was truly an epic destiny that inspired both poet and hero.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An ideal background required.</div>

<p>If we look closer, however, we shall see that mythical and magic
elements were requisite to lend this loftiness to the argument. Had
&AElig;neas not been Venus's son, had no prophetic instinct animated him, had
no Juno been planning the rise of Carthage, how could the future
destinies of this expedition have been imported into it, to lift it
above some piratical or desperate venture? Colonists passing in our day
to America or Australia might conceivably carry with them the seeds of
empires as considerable as Rome's. But they would go out thinking of
their private livelihood and convenience, breaking or loosening whatever
pious bonds might unite them to the past, and quite irresponsibly laying
the foundations for an unknown future. A poet, to raise them to the
height of their unwitting function, would have to endow them with second
sight and a corresponding breadth of soul and purpose. He would need, in
a word, heroic figures and supernatural machinery.</p>

<p>Now, what supernatural machinery and heroic figures do for an epic poet
piety does for a race. It endows it, through mythical and magic symbols,
with something like a vision or representation of its past and future.
Religion is normally the most <a name="Page_182" id="Page_182" />traditional and national of things. It
embodies and localises the racial heritage. Commandments of the law,
feasts and fasts, temples and the tombs associated with them, are so
many foci of communal life, so many points for the dissemination of
custom. The Sabbath, which a critical age might justify on hygienic
grounds, is inconceivable without a religious sanction. The craving for
rest and emotion expressed itself spontaneously in a practice which, as
it established itself, had to be sanctioned by fables till the recurrent
holiday, with all its humane and chastening influences, came to be
established on supernatural authority. It was now piety to observe it
and to commemorate in it the sacred duties and traditions of the race.
In this function, of course, lay its true justification, but the
mythical one had to be assigned, since the diffused prosaic advantages
of such a practice would never avail to impose it on irrational wills.
Indeed, to revert to our illustration, had &AElig;neas foreseen in detail the
whole history of Rome, would not his faith in his divine mission have
been considerably dashed? The reality, precious and inestimable as on
the whole it was to humanity, might well have shocked him by its
cruelties, shames, and disasters. He would have wished to found only a
perfect nation and a city eternal indeed. A want of rationality and
measure in the human will, that has not learned to prize small
betterments and finite but real goods, compels it to deceive itself
about the rewards of life in order <a name="Page_183" id="Page_183" />to secure them. That celestial
mission, those heavenly apparitions, those incalculable treasures
carried through many a storm, abused &AElig;Eneas's mind in order to nerve him
to his real duty. Yet his illusion was merely intellectual. The mission
undertaken was truly worth carrying out. Piety thus came to bear the
fruits of philanthropy in an age when the love of man was inconceivable.
A dull and visionary intellect could hit on no other way of justifying a
good instinct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Piety accepts natural conditions and present tasks.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The leadership of instinct is normal.</div>

<p>Philosophers who harbour illusions about the status of intellect in
nature may feel that this leadership of instinct in moral life is a sort
of indignity, and that to dwell on it so insistently is to prolong
satire without wit. But the leadership of instinct, the conscious
expression of mechanism, is not merely a necessity in the Life of
Reason, it is a safeguard. Piety, in spite of its allegories, contains a
much greater wisdom than a half-enlightened and pert intellect can
attain. Natural beings have natural obligations, and the value of things
for them is qualified by distance and by accidental material
connections. Intellect would tend to gauge things impersonally by their
intrinsic values, since intellect is itself a sort of disembodied and
universal function; it would tend to disregard material conditions and
that irrational substratum of reason without which reason would have no
organs and no points of application. Piety, <a name="Page_184" id="Page_184" />on the contrary, esteems
things apart from their intrinsic worth, on account of their relation to
the agent's person and fortune. Yet such esteem is perfectly rational,
partiality in man's affections and allegiance being justified by the
partial nature and local status of his life. Piety is the spirit's
acknowledgment of its incarnation. So, in filial and parental affection,
which is piety in an elementary form, there is a moulding of will and
emotion, a check to irresponsible initiative, in obedience to the facts
of animal reproduction. Every living creature has an intrinsic and ideal
worth; he is the centre of actual and yet more of potential interests.
But this moral value, which even the remotest observer must recognise in
both parent and child, is not the ground of their specific affection for
each other, which no other mortal is called to feel their regard. This
affection is based on the incidental and irrational fact that the one
has this particular man for a father, and the other that particular man
for a son. Yet, considering the animal basis of human life, an
attachment resting on that circumstance is a necessary and rational
attachment.</p>

<p>This physical bond should not, indeed, disturb the intellect in its
proper function or warp its judgments; you should not, under guise of
tenderness, become foolish and attribute to your father or child greater
stature or cleverness or goodness than he actually possesses. To do so
is a natural foible <a name="Page_185" id="Page_185" />but no part of piety or true loyalty. It is one
thing to lack a heart and another to possess eyes and a just
imagination. Indeed, piety is never so beautiful and touching, never so
thoroughly humane and invincible, as when it is joined to an impartial
intellect, conscious of the relativity involved in existence and able to
elude, through imaginative sympathy, the limits set to personal life by
circumstance and private duty. As a man dies nobly when, awaiting his
own extinction, he is interested to the last in what will continue to be
the interests and joys of others, so he is most profoundly pious who
loves unreservedly a country, friends, and associations which he knows
very well to be not the most beautiful on earth, and who, being wholly
content in his personal capacity with his natural conditions, does not
need to begrudge other things whatever speculative admiration they may
truly deserve. The ideal in this polyglot world, where reason can
receive only local and temporal expression, is to understand all
languages and to speak but one, so as to unite, in a manly fashion,
comprehension with propriety.</p>

<p>Piety is in a sense pathetic because it involves subordination to
physical accident and acceptance of finitude. But it is also noble and
eminently fruitful because, in subsuming a life under the general laws
of relativity, it meets fate with simple sincerity and labours in
accordance with the conditions imposed. Since man, though capable of
abstraction and impartiality, is rooted like a <a name="Page_186" id="Page_186" />vegetable to one point
in space and time, and exists by limitation, piety belongs to the
equilibrium of his being. It resides, so to speak, at his centre of
gravity, at the heart and magnetic focus of his complex endowment. It
exercises there the eminently sane function of calling thought home. It
saves speculative and emotional life from hurtful extravagance by
keeping it traditional and social. Conventional absurdities have at
least this advantage, that they may be taken conventionally and may come
to be, in practice, mere symbols for their uses. Piety is more closely
linked with custom than with thought. It exercises an irrational
suasion, moralises by contagion, and brings an emotional peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Embodiment essential to spirit.</div>

<p>Patriotism is another form of piety in which its natural basis and
rational function may be clearly seen. It is right to prefer our own
essential to country to all others, because we are children and citizens
before we can be travellers or philosophers. Specific character is a
necessary point of origin for universal relations: a pure nothing can
have no radiation or scope. It is no accident for the soul to be
embodied; her very essence is to express and bring to fruition the
body's functions and resources. Its instincts make her ideals and its
relations her world. A native country is a sort of second body, another
enveloping organism to give the will definition. A specific inheritance
strengthens the soul. Cosmopolitanism has doubtless its place, because a
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187" />man may well cultivate in himself, and represent in his nation,
affinities to other peoples, and such assimilation to them as is
compatible with personal integrity and clearness of purpose. Plasticity
to things foreign need not be inconsistent with happiness and utility at
home. But happiness and utility are possible nowhere to a man who
represents nothing and who looks out on the world without a plot of his
own to stand on, either on earth or in heaven. He wanders from place to
place, a voluntary exile, always querulous, always uneasy, always alone.
His very criticisms express no ideal. His experience is without
sweetness, without cumulative fruits, and his children, if he has them,
are without morality. For reason and happiness are like other
flowers&mdash;they wither when plucked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Piety to the gods takes form from current ideals.</div>

<p>The object most commonly associated with piety is the gods. Popular
philosophy, inverting the natural order of ideas, thinks piety to the
gods the source of morality. But piety, when genuine, is rather an
incidental expression of morality. Its sources are perfectly natural. A
volitional life that reaches the level of reflection is necessarily
moral in proportion to the concreteness and harmony of its instincts.
The fruits which such harmonious instincts, expressed in consciousness,
may eventually bear, fruits which would be the aim of virtue, are not
readily imaginable, and the description of them has long ago been
intrusted to poets and <a name="Page_188" id="Page_188" />mythologists. Thus the love of God, for example,
is said to be the root of Christian charity, but is in reality only its
symbol. For no man not having a superabundant need and faculty of loving
real things could have given a meaning to the phrase, &quot;love of God,&quot; or
been moved by it to any action. History shows in unequivocal fashion
that the God loved shifts his character with the shift in his
worshippers' real affections. What the psalmist loves is the beauty of
God's house and the place where his glory dwelleth. A priestly quietude
and pride, a grateful, meditative leisure after the storms of sedition
and war, some retired unity of mind after the contradictions of the
world&mdash;this is what the love of God might signify for the levites. Saint
John tells us that he who says he loves God and loves not his neighbour
is a liar. Here the love of God is an anti-worldly estimation of things
and persons, a heart set on that kingdom of heaven in which the humble
and the meek should be exalted. Again, for modern Catholicism the phrase
has changed its meaning remarkably and signifies in effect love for
Christ's person, because piety has taken a sentimental turn and centred
on maintaining imaginary personal relations with the Saviour. How should
we conceive that a single supernatural influence was actually
responsible for moral effects themselves so various, and producing, in
spite of a consecutive tradition, such various notions concerning their
object and supposed source?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189" />The religion of humanity.</div>

<p>Mankind at large is also, to some minds, an object of piety. But this
religion of humanity is rather a desideratum than a fact: humanity does
not actually appear to anybody in a religious light. The <i>nihil homine
homini utittus</i> remains a signal truth, but the collective influence of
men and their average nature are far too mixed and ambiguous to fill the
soul with veneration. Piety to mankind must be three-fourths pity. There
are indeed specific human virtues, but they are those necessary to
existence, like patience and courage. Supported on these indispensable
habits, mankind always carries an indefinite load of misery and vice.
Life spreads rankly in every wrong and impracticable direction as well
as in profitable paths, and the slow and groping struggle with its own
ignorance, inertia, and folly, leaves it covered in every age of history
with filth and blood. It would hardly be possible to exaggerate man's
wretchedness if it were not so easy to overestimate his sensibility.
There is a <i>fond</i> of unhappiness in every bosom, but the depths are
seldom probed; and there is no doubt that sometimes frivolity and
sometimes sturdy habit helps to keep attention on the surface and to
cover up the inner void. Certain moralists, without meaning to be
satirical, often say that the sovereign cure for unhappiness is work.
Unhappily, the work they recommend is better fitted to dull pain than to
remove its cause. It occupies the faculties without rationalising the
life. Before <a name="Page_190" id="Page_190" />mankind could inspire even moderate satisfaction, not to
speak of worship, its whole economy would have to be reformed, its
reproduction regulated, its thoughts cleared up, its affections
equalised and refined.</p>

<p>To worship mankind as it is would be to deprive it of what alone makes
it akin to the divine&mdash;its aspiration. For this human dust lives; this
misery and crime are dark in contrast to an imagined excellence; they
are lighted up by a prospect of good. Man is not adorable, but he
adores, and the object of his adoration may be discovered within him and
elicited from his own soul. In this sense the religion of humanity is
the only religion, all others being sparks and abstracts of the same.
The indwelling ideal lends all the gods their divinity. No power, either
physical or psychical, has the least moral prerogative nor any just
place in religion at all unless it supports and advances the ideal
native to the worshipper's soul. Without moral society between the
votary and his god religion is pure idolatry; and even idolatry would be
impossible but for the suspicion that somehow the brute force exorcised
in prayer might help or mar some human undertaking.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cosmic piety.</div>

<p>There is, finally, a philosophic piety which has the universe for its
object. This feeling, common to ancient and modern Stoics, has an
obvious justification in man's dependence upon the natural world and in
its service to many sides of the mind. Such justification of cos<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191" />mic
piety is rather obscured than supported by the euphemisms and
ambiguities in which these philosophers usually indulge in their attempt
to preserve the customary religious unction. For the more they personify
the universe and give it the name of God the more they turn it into a
devil. The universe, so far as we can observe it, is a wonderful and
immense engine; its extent, its order, its beauty, its cruelty, makes it
alike impressive. If we dramatise its life and conceive its spirit, we
are filled with wonder, terror, and amusement, so magnificent is that
spirit, so prolific, inexorable, grammatical, and dull. Like all animals
and plants, the cosmos has its own way of doing things, not wholly
rational nor ideally best, but patient, fatal, and fruitful. Great is
this organism of mud and fire, terrible this vast, painful, glorious
experiment. Why should we not look on the universe with piety? Is it not
our substance? Are we made of other clay? All our possibilities lie from
eternity hidden in its bosom. It is the dispenser of all our joys. We
may address it without superstitious terrors; it is not wicked. It
follows its own habits abstractedly; it can be trusted to be true to its
word. Society is not impossible between it and us, and since it is the
source of all our energies, the home of all our happiness, shall we not
cling to it and praise it, seeing that it vegetates so grandly and so
sadly, and that it is not for us to blame it for what, doubtless, it
never knew that it did? Where there is such infinite <a name="Page_192" id="Page_192" />and laborious
potency there is room for every hope. If we should abstain from judging
a father's errors or a mother's foibles, why should we pronounce
sentence on the ignorant crimes of the universe, which have passed into
our own blood? The universe is the true Adam, the creation the true
fall; and as we have never blamed our mythical first parent very much,
in spite of the disproportionate consequences of his sin, because we
felt that he was but human and that we, in his place, might have sinned
too, so we may easily forgive our real ancestor, whose connatural sin we
are from moment to moment committing, since it is only the necessary
rashness of venturing to be without fore-knowing the price or the fruits
of existence.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>SPIRITUALITY AND ITS CORRUPTIONS</p>


<div class="sidenote">To be spiritual is to live in view of the ideal.</div>

<p>In honouring the sources of life, piety is retrospective. It collects,
as it were, food for morality, and fortifies it with natural and
historic nutriment. But a digestive and formative principle must exist
to assimilate this nutriment; a direction and an ideal have to be
imposed on these gathered forces. So that religion has a second and a
higher side, which looks to the end toward which we move as piety looks
to the conditions of progress and to the sources from which we draw our
energies. This aspiring side of religion may be called Spirituality.
Spirituality is nobler than piety, because what would fulfil our being
and make it worth having is what alone lends value to that being's
source. Nothing can be lower or more wholly instrumental than the
substance and cause of all things. The gift of existence would be
worthless unless existence was good and supported at least a possible
happiness. A man is spiritual when he lives in the presence of the
ideal, and whether he eat or drink does so for the sake of a true and
ultimate good. He is spiritual when he envisages his <a name="Page_194" id="Page_194" />goal so frankly
that his whole material life becomes a transparent and transitive
vehicle, an instrument which scarcely arrests attention but allows the
spirit to use it economically and with perfect detachment and freedom.</p>

<p>There is no need that this ideal should be pompously or mystically
described. A simple life is its own reward, and continually realises its
function. Though a spiritual man may perfectly well go through intricate
processes of thought and attend to very complex affairs, his single eye,
fixed on a rational purpose, will simplify morally the natural chaos it
looks upon and will remain free. This spiritual mastery is, of course,
no slashing and forced synthesis of things into a system of philosophy
which, even if it were thinkable, would leave the conceived logical
machine without ideality and without responsiveness to actual interests;
it is rather an inward aim and fixity in affection that knows what to
take and what to leave in a world over which it diffuses something of
its own peace. It threads its way through the landscape with so little
temptation to distraction that it can salute every irrelevant thing, as
Saint Francis did the sun and moon, with courtesy and a certain
affectionate detachment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spirituality natural.</div>

<p>Spirituality likes to say, Behold the lilies of the field! For its
secret has the same simplicity as their vegetative art; only
spirituality has succeeded in adding consciousness without confusing
instinct. This success, unfor<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195" />tunately so rare in man's life as to seem
paradoxical, is its whole achievement. Spirituality ought to have been a
matter of course, since conscious existence has inherent value and there
is no intrinsic ground why it should smother that value in alien
ambitions and servitudes. But spirituality, though so natural and
obvious a thing, is subject, like the lilies' beauty, to corruption. I
know not what army of microbes evidently invaded from the beginning the
soul's physical basis and devoured its tissues, so that sophistication
and bad dreams entirely obscured her limpidity.</p>

<p>None the less, spirituality, or life in the ideal, must be regarded as
the fundamental and native type of all life; what deviates from it is
disease and incipient dissolution, and is itself what might plausibly
demand explanation and evoke surprise. The spiritual man should be quite
at home in a world made to be used; the firmament is spread over him
like a tent for habitation, and sublunary furniture is even more
obviously to be taken as a convenience. He cannot, indeed, remove
mountains, but neither does he wish to do so. He comes to endow the
mountains with a function, and takes them at that, as a painter might
take his brushes and canvas. Their beauty, their metals, their
pasturage, their defence&mdash;this is what he observes in them and
celebrates in his addresses to them. The spiritual man, though not
ashamed to be a beggar, is cognisant of what wealth can do and of what
it cannot. His unworldliness is true <a name="Page_196" id="Page_196" />knowledge of the world, not so
much a gaping and busy acquaintance as a quiet comprehension and
estimation which, while it cannot come without intercourse, can very
well lay intercourse aside.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Primitive consciousness may be spiritual.</div>

<p>If the essence of life be spiritual, early examples of life would seem
to be rather the opposite. But man's view of primitive consciousness is
humanly biassed and relies too much on partial analogies. We conceive an
animal's physical life in the gross, and must then regard the momentary
feelings that accompany it as very poor expressions either of its extent
or conditions. These feelings are, indeed, so many ephemeral lives,
containing no comprehensive view of the animal's fortunes. They
accordingly fail to realise our notion of a spiritual human life which
would have to be rational and to form some representation of man's total
environment and interests. But it hardly follows that animal feelings
are not spiritual in their nature and, on their narrow basis, perfectly
ideal. The most ideal human passion is love, which is also the most
absolute and animal and one of the most ephemeral. Very likely, if we
could revert to an innocent and absorbed view of our early sensations,
we should find that each was a little spiritual universe like Dante's,
with its internal hell, purgatory, and heaven. Cut off, as those
experiences were, from all vistas and from sympathy with things remote,
they would contain a closed circle of interests, a flying glimpse of
eternity. So an infant living <a name="Page_197" id="Page_197" />in his mystical limbo, without trailing
in a literal sense any clouds of glory from elsewhere, might well repeat
on a diminutive scale the beatific vision, insomuch as the only function
of which he was conscious at all might be perfectly fulfilled by him and
felt in its ideal import. Sucking and blinking are ridiculous processes,
perhaps, but they may bring a thrill and satisfaction no less ideal than
do the lark's inexhaustible palpitations. Narrow scope and low
representative value are not defects in a consciousness having a narrow
physical basis and comparatively simple conditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spirit crossed by instrumentalities.</div>

<p>The spirit's foe in man has not been simplicity, but sophistication. His
instincts, in becoming many, became confused, and in growing permanent,
grew feeble and subject to arrest and deviation. Nature, we may say,
threw the brute form back into her cauldron, to smelt its substance
again before pouring it into a rational mould. The docility which
instinct, in its feebleness, acquired in the new creature was to be
reason's opportunity, but before the larger harmony could be established
a sorry chaos was bound to reign in the mind. Every peeping impulse
would drop its dark hint and hide its head in confusion, while some
pedantic and unjust law would be passed in its absence and without its
vote. Secondary activities, which should always be representative, would
establish themselves without being really such. Means would be pursued
as if they were ends, and ends, under the illusion <a name="Page_198" id="Page_198" />that they were
forces, would be expected to further some activity, itself without
justification. So pedantry might be substituted for wisdom, tyranny for
government, superstition for morals, rhetoric for art.</p>

<p>This sophistication is what renders the pursuit of reason so perplexing
and prolonged a problem. Half-formed adjustments in the brain and in the
body politic are represented in consciousness by what are called
passions, prejudices, motives, animosities. None of these felt
ebullitions in the least understands its own causes, effects, or
relations, but is hatched, so to speak, on the wing and flutters along
in the direction of its momentary preference until it lapses, it knows
not why, or is crossed and overwhelmed by some contrary power. Thus the
vital elements, which in their comparative isolation in the lower
animals might have yielded simple little dramas, each with its obvious
ideal, its achievement, and its quietus, when mixed in the barbarous
human will make a boisterous medley. For they are linked enough together
to feel a strain, but not knit enough to form a harmony. In this way the
unity of apperception seems to light up at first nothing but disunion.
The first dawn of that rational principle which involves immortality
breaks upon a discovery of death. The consequence is that ideality seems
to man something supernatural and almost impossible. He finds himself at
his awakening so confused that he puts chaos at the origin of the world.
But <a name="Page_199" id="Page_199" />only order can beget a world or evoke a sensation. Chaos is
something secondary, composed of conflicting organisations interfering
with one another. It is compounded like a common noise out of jumbled
vibrations, each of which has its period and would in itself be musical.
The problem is to arrange these sounds, naturally so tuneful, into
concerted music. So long as total discord endures human life remains
spasmodic and irresolute; it can find no ideal and admit no total
representation of nature. Only when the disordered impulses and
perceptions settle down into a trained instinct, a steady, vital
response and adequate preparation for the world, do clear ideas and
successful purposes arise in the mind. The Life of Reason, with all the
arts, then begins its career.</p>

<p>The forces at play in this drama are, first, the primary impulses and
functions represented by elementary values; second, the thin network of
signals and responses by which those functions are woven into a total
organ, represented by discursive thought and all secondary mental
figments, and, third, the equilibrium and total power of that new
organism in action represented by the ideal. Spirituality, which might
have resided in the elementary values, sensuous or passionate, before
the relational process supervened, can now exist only in the ultimate
activity to which these processes are instrumental. Obstacles to
spirituality in human life may accordingly take the form of an arrest
either at the elementary values&mdash;an entan<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200" />glement in sense and
passion&mdash;or at the instrumental processes&mdash;an entanglement in what in
religious parlance is called &quot;the world.&quot;</p>

<div class="sidenote">One foe of the spirit is worldliness.</div>

<p>Worldly minds bristle with conventional morality (though in private they
may nurse a vice or two to appease wayward nature), and they are
rational in everything except first principles. They consider the
voluptuary a weak fool, disgraced and disreputable; and if they notice
the spiritual man at all&mdash;for he is easily ignored&mdash;they regard him as a
useless and visionary fellow. Civilisation has to work algebraically
with symbols for known and unknown quantities which only in the end
resume their concrete values, so that the journeymen and vulgar
middlemen of the world know only conventional goods. They are lost in
instrumentalities and are themselves only instruments in the Life of
Reason. Wealth, station, fame, success of some notorious and outward
sort, make their standard of happiness. Their chosen virtues are
industry, good sense, probity, conventional piety, and whatever else has
acknowledged utility and seemliness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The case for and against pleasure.</div>

<p>In its strictures on pleasure and reverie this Philistia is perfectly
right. Sensuous living (and I do not mean debauchery alone, but the
palpitations of any poet without art or any mystic without discipline)
is not only inconsequential and shallow, but dangerous to honour and to
sincere happiness. When life remains lost in sense or reverts to it
entirely, hu<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201" />manity itself is atrophied. And humanity is tormented and
spoilt when, as more often happens, a man disbelieving in reason and out
of humour with his world, abandons his soul to loose whimseys and
passions that play a quarrelsome game there, like so many ill-bred
children. Nevertheless, compared with the worldling's mental mechanism
and rhetoric, the sensualist's soul is a well of wisdom. He lives
naturally on an animal level and attains a kind of good. He has free and
concrete pursuits, though they be momentary, and he has sincere
satisfactions. He is less often corrupt than primitive, and even when
corrupt he finds some justification for his captious existence. He
harvests pleasures as he goes which intrinsically, as we have seen, may
have the depth and ideality which nature breathes in all her oracles.
His experience, for that reason, though disastrous is interesting and
has some human pathos; it is easier to make a saint out of a libertine
than out of a prig. True, the libertine is pursued, like the animals, by
unforeseen tortures, decay, and abandonment, and he is vowed to a total
death; but in these respects the worldly man has hardly an advantage.
The Babels he piles up may indeed survive his person, but they are
themselves vain and without issue, while his brief life has been
meantime spent in slavery and his mind cramped with cant and foolish
ambitions. The voluptuary is like some roving creature, browsing on
nettles and living by chance; the worldling is like a beast of burden,
now ill-used and over-<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202" />worked, now fatted, stalled, and richly
caparisoned. &AElig;sop might well have described their relative happiness in
a fable about the wild ass and the mule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Upshot of worldly wisdom.</div>

<p>Thus, even if the voluptuary is sometimes a poet and the worldling often
an honest man, they both lack reason so entirely that reflection revolts
equally against the life of both. Vanity, vanity, is their common
epitaph. Now, at the soul's christening and initiation into the Life of
Reason, the first vow must always be to &quot;renounce the pomps and vanities
of this wicked world.&quot; A person to whom this means nothing is one to
whom, in the end, nothing has meaning. He has not conceived a highest
good, no ultimate goal is within his horizon, and it has never occurred
to him to ask what he is living for. With all his pompous soberness, the
worldly man is fundamentally frivolous; with all his maxims and cant
estimations he is radically inane. He conforms to religion without
suspecting what religion means, not being in the least open to such an
inquiry. He judges art like a parrot, without having ever stopped to
evoke an image. He preaches about service and duty without any
recognition of natural demands or any standard of betterment. His moral
life is one vast anacoluthon in which the final term is left out that
might have given sense to the whole, one vast ellipsis in which custom
seems to bridge the chasm left between ideas. He denies the values of
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203" />sense because they tempt to truancies from mechanical activity; the
values of reason he necessarily ignores because they lie beyond his
scope. He adheres to conventional maxims and material quantitative
standards; his production is therefore, as far as he himself is
concerned, an essential waste and his activity an essential tedium. If
at least, like the sensualist, he enjoyed the process and expressed his
fancy in his life, there would be something gained; and this sort of
gain, though over-looked in the worldling's maxims, all of which have a
categorical tone, is really what often lends his life some propriety and
spirit. Business and war and any customary task may come to form, so to
speak, an organ whose natural function will be just that operation, and
the most abstract and secondary activity, like that of adding figures or
reading advertisements, may in this way become the one function proper
to some soul. There are Nibelungen dwelling by choice underground and
happy pedants in the upper air.</p>

<p>Facts are not wanting for these pillars of society to take solace in, if
they wish to defend their philosophy. The time will come, astronomers
say, when life will be extinct upon this weary planet. All the delights
of sense and imagination will be over. It is these that will have turned
out to be vain. But the masses of matter which the worldlings have
transformed with their machinery, and carried from one place to another,
will remain to bear witness of them. The collocation of atoms <a name="Page_204" id="Page_204" />will
never be what it would have been if their feet had less continually
beaten the earth. They may have the proud happiness of knowing that,
when nothing that the spirit values endures, the earth may still
sometimes, because of them, cast a slightly different shadow across the
moon's craters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two supposed escapes from vanity:</div>

<p>There is no more critical moment in the life of a man and a nation than
that in which they are first conscience-stricken and convicted of
vanity. Failure, exhaustion, confusion of aims, or whatever else it be
that causes a revulsion, brings them before a serious dilemma. Has the
vanity of life hitherto been essential or incidental? Are we to look for
a new ambition, free from all the illusions of natural impulse, or are
we rather to renounce all will indiscriminately and fall back upon
conformity and consummate indifference? As this question is answered in
one way or the other, two different types of unworldly religion arise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fanaticism.</div>

<p>The first, which heralds a new and unimpeachable special hope, a highest
duty finally recognised and driving out all lesser motives and
satisfactions from the soul, refers vanity to perversity, to error, to a
sort of original misunderstanding of our own nature which has led us, in
pursuing our worldly interests, to pursue in truth our own destruction.
The vanity of life, according to this belief, has been accidental. The
taint of existence is not innate vanity but casual sin; what has misled
us is not the will in general <a name="Page_205" id="Page_205" />but only the false and ignorant direction
of a will not recognising its only possible satisfaction. What religion
in this case opposes to the world is a special law, a special hope, a
life intense, ambitious, and aggressive, but excluding much which to an
ingenuous will might seem excellent and tempting. Worldliness, in a
word, is here met by fanaticism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and mysticism.</div>

<p>The second type of unworldly religion does not propose to overwhelm the
old Adam by singleminded devotion to one selected interest, nor does it
refer vanity to an accidental error. On the contrary, it conceives that
any special interest, any claim made by a finite and mortal creature
upon an infinite world, is bound to be defeated. It is not special acts,
it conceives, which are sinful, but action and will themselves that are
intrinsically foolish. The cure lies in rescinding the passionate
interests that torment us, not in substituting for them another
artificial passion more imperious and merciless than the natural
passions it comes to devour. This form of religion accordingly meets
worldliness with mysticism. Holiness is not placed in conformity to a
prescriptive law, in pursuit of a slightly regenerated bliss, nor in
advancing a special institution and doctrine. Holiness for the mystic
consists rather in universal mildness and insight; in freedom from all
passion, bias, and illusion; in a disembodied wisdom which accepts the
world, dominates its labyrinths, and is able to guide others <a name="Page_206" id="Page_206" />through
it, without pursuing, for its own part, any hope or desire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Both are irrational.</div>

<p>If these two expedients of the conscience convicted of vanity were to be
subjected to a critical judgment, they would both be convicted of vanity
themselves. The case of fanaticism is not doubtful, for the choice it
makes of a special law or institution or posthumous hope is purely
arbitrary, and only to be justified by the satisfaction it affords to
those very desires which it boasts to supplant. An oracular morality or
revealed religion can hope to support its singular claims only by
showing its general conformity to natural reason and its perfect
beneficence in the world. Where such justification is wanting the system
fanatically embraced is simply an epidemic mania, a social disease for
the philosopher to study and, if possible, to cure. Every strong passion
tends to dislodge the others, so that fanaticism may often involve a
certain austerity, impetuosity, and intensity of life. This vigour,
however, is seldom lasting; fanaticism dries its own roots and becomes,
when traditionally established, a convention as arbitrary as any fashion
and the nest for a new brood of mean and sinister habits. The Pharisee
is a new worldling, only his little world is narrowed to a temple, a
tribe, and a clerical tradition.</p>

<p>Mysticism, as its meditative nature comports, is never so pernicious,
nor can it be brought so easily round to worldliness again. That its
beneficent <a name="Page_207" id="Page_207" />element is purely natural and inconsistent with a denial of
will, we shall have occasion elsewhere to observe. Suffice it here to
point out, that even if a moral nihilism could be carried through and
all definite interests abandoned, the vanity of life would not be
thereby corrected, but merely exposed. When our steps had been retraced
to the very threshold of being, nothing better worth doing would have
been discovered on the way. That to suffer illusion is a bad thing might
ordinarily be taken for an axiom, because ordinarily we assume that true
knowledge and rational volition are possible; but if this assumption is
denied, the value of retracting illusions is itself impeached. When
vanity is represented as universal and salvation as purely negative,
every one is left free to declare that it is vain to renounce vanity and
sinful to seek salvation.</p>

<p>This result, fantastic though it may at first sight appear, is one which
mysticism actually comes to under certain circumstances. Absolute
pessimism and absolute optimism are opposite sentiments attached to a
doctrine identically the same. In either case no improvement is
possible, and the authority of human ideals is denied. To escape, to
stanch natural wounds, to redeem society and the private soul, are then
mistaken and pitiable ambitions, adding to their vanity a certain touch
of impiety. One who really believes that the world's work is all
providentially directed and that whatever happens, no matter how
calamitous or <a name="Page_208" id="Page_208" />shocking, happens by divine right, has a quietistic
excuse for license; to check energy by reason, and seek to limit and
choose its path, seems to him a puny rebellion against omnipotence,
which works through madness and crime in man no less than through
cataclysms in outer nature. Every particular desire is vain and bound,
perhaps, to be defeated; but the mystic, when caught in the expansive
mood, accepts this defeat itself as needful. Thus a refusal to
discriminate rationally or to accept human interests as the standard of
right may culminate in a convulsive surrender to passion, just as, when
caught in the contractile phase, the same mysticism may lead to
universal abstention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is there a third course?</div>

<p>Must unworldliness be either fanatical or mystical? That is a question
of supreme importance to the moral philosopher. On the answer to it
hangs the rationality of a spiritual life; nay, the existence of
spirituality itself among the types of human activity. For the fanatic
and mystic are only spiritual in appearance because they separate
themselves from the prevalent interests of the world, the one by a
special persistent aggression, the other by a general passivity and
unearthly calm. The fanatic is, notwithstanding, nothing but a worldling
too narrow and violent to understand the world, while the mystic is a
sensualist too rapt and voluptuous to rationalise his sensations. Both
represent arrested forms of common-sense, partial developments of a
perfectly usual sensibility. There is no divine <a name="Page_209" id="Page_209" />inspiration in having
only one passion left, nor in dreamfully accepting or renouncing all the
passions together. Spirituality, if identified with such types, might
justly be called childish. There is an innocent and incredulous
childishness, with its useless eyes wide open, just as there is a
malevolent and peevish childishness, eaten up with some mischievous
whim. The man of experience and affairs can very quickly form an opinion
on such phenomena. He has no reason to expect superior wisdom in those
quarters. On the contrary, his own customary political and humane
standpoint gives him the only authoritative measure of their merits and
possible uses. &quot;These sectaries and dreamers,&quot; he will say to himself,
&quot;cannot understand one another nor the role they themselves play in
society. It is for us to make the best of them we can, taking such
prudent measures as are possible to enlist the forces they represent in
works of common utility.&quot;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Yes; for experience has intrinsic inalienable values.</div>

<p>The philosopher's task, in these premisses, is to discover an escape
from worldliness which shall offer a rational advance over it, such as
fanaticism and mysticism cannot afford. Does the Life of Reason differ
from that of convention? Is there a spirituality really wiser than
common-sense? That there is appears in many directions. Worldliness is
arrest and absorption in the instrumentalities of life; but
instrumentalities cannot exist without ultimate purposes, and it
suffices to lift the eyes <a name="Page_210" id="Page_210" />to those purposes and to question the will
sincerely about its essential preferences, to institute a catalogue of
rational goods, by pursuing any of which we escape worldliness. Sense
itself is one of these goods. The sensualist at least is not worldly,
and though his nature be atrophied in all its higher part, there is not
lacking, as we have seen, a certain internal and abstract spirituality
in his experience. He is a sort of sprightly and incidental mystic,
treating his varied succession of little worlds as the mystic does his
monotonous universe. Sense, moreover, is capable of many refinements, by
which physical existence becomes its own reward. In the disciplined play
of fancy which the fine arts afford, the mind's free action justifies
itself and becomes intrinsically delightful. Science not only exercises
in itself the intellectual powers, but assimilates nature to the mind,
so that all things may nourish it. In love and friendship the liberal
life extends also to the heart. All these interests, which justify
themselves by their intrinsic fruits, make so many rational episodes and
patches in conventional life; but it must be confessed in all candour
that these are but oases in the desert, and that as the springs of life
are irrational, so its most vehement and prevalent interests remain
irrational to the end. When the pleasures of sense and art, of knowledge
and sympathy, are stretched to the utmost, what part will they cover and
justify of our passions, our industry, our governments, our religion?</p>

<p><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211" />It was a signal error in those rationalists who attributed their ideal
retrospectively to nature that they grotesquely imagined that people
were hungry so that they might enjoy eating, or curious in order to
delight in discovering the truth, or in love the better to live in
conscious harmony. Such a view forgets that all the forces of life work
originally and fundamentally <i>a tergo</i>, that experience and reason are
not the ground of preference but its result. In order to live men will
work disproportionately and eat all manner of filth without pleasure;
curiosity as often as not leads to illusion, and argument serves to
foster hatred of the truth; finally, love is notoriously a great
fountain of bitterness and frequently a prelude to crime and death. When
we have skimmed from life its incidental successes, when we have
harvested the moments in which existence justifies itself, its profound
depths remain below in their obscure commotion, depths that breed indeed
a rational efflorescence, but which are far from exhausted in producing
it, and continually threaten, on the contrary, to engulf it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">For these the religious imagination must supply an ideal
standard.</div>

<p>The spiritual man needs, therefore, something more than a cultivated
sympathy with the brighter scintillation of things. He needs to refer
that scintillation to some essential light, so that in reviewing the
motley aspects of experience he may not be reduced to culling
superciliously the flowers that please him, but may view in them all
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212" />only images and varied symbols of some eternal good. Spirituality has
never flourished apart from religion, except momentarily, perhaps, in
some master-mind, whose original intuitions at once became a religion to
his followers. For it is religion that knows how to interpret the casual
rationalities in the world and isolate their principle, setting this
principle up in the face of nature as nature's standard and model. This
ideal synthesis of all that is good, this consciousness that over earth
floats its congenial heaven, this vision of perfection which gilds
beauty and sanctifies grief, has taken form, for the most part, in such
grossly material images, in a mythology so opaque and pseudo-physical,
that its ideal and moral essence has been sadly obscured; nevertheless,
every religion worthy of the name has put into its gods some element of
real goodness, something by which they become representative of those
scattered excellences and self-justifying bits of experience in which
the Life of Reason consists.</p>

<p>That happy constitution which human life has at its best moments&mdash;that,
says Aristotle, the divine life has continually. The philosopher thus
expressed with absolute clearness the principle which the poets had been
clumsily trying to embody from the beginning. Burdened as traditional
faiths might be with cosmological and fanciful matter, they still
presented in a conspicuous and permanent image that which made all good
things good, the ideal and standard of all excellence. By <a name="Page_213" id="Page_213" />the help of
such symbols the spiritual man could steer and steady his judgment; he
could say, according to the form religion had taken in his country, that
the truly good was what God commanded, or what made man akin to the
divine, or what led the soul to heaven. Such expressions, though taken
more or less literally by a metaphysical intellect, did not wholly
forfeit their practical and moral meaning. God, for a long time, was
understood to command what in fact was truly important, the divine was
long the truly noble and beautiful, heaven hardly ever ceased to respond
to impersonal and ideal aspirations. Under those figures, therefore, the
ideals of life could confront life with clearness and authority. The
spiritual man, fixing his eyes on them, could live in the presence of
ultimate purposes and ideal issues. Before each immediate task, each
incidental pleasure, each casual success, he could retain his sweetness
and constancy, accepting what good these moments brought and laying it
on the altar of what they ought to bring.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>CHARITY</p>


<div class="sidenote">Possible tyranny of reason.</div>

<p>Those whom a genuine spirituality has freed from the foolish enchantment
of words and conventions and brought back to a natural ideal, have still
another illusion to vanquish, one into which the very concentration and
deepening of their life might lead them. This illusion is that they and
their chosen interests alone are important or have a legitimate place in
the moral world. Having discovered what is really good for themselves,
they assume that the like is good for everybody. Having made a tolerable
synthesis and purification of their own natures, they require every
other nature to be composed of the same elements similarly combined.
What they have vanquished in themselves they disregard in others; and
the consequence sometimes is that an impossibly simplified and
inconsiderate regimen is proposed to mankind, altogether
unrepresentative of their total interests. Spiritual men, in a word, may
fall into the aristocrat's fallacy; they may forget the infinite animal
and vulgar life which remains <a name="Page_215" id="Page_215" />quite disjointed, impulsive, and
short-winded, but which nevertheless palpitates with joys and sorrows,
and makes after all the bulk of moral values in this democratic world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Everything has its rights.</div>

<p>After adopting an ideal it is necessary, therefore, without abandoning
it, to recognise its relativity. The right path is in such a matter
rather difficult to keep to. On the one hand lies fanatical insistence
on an ideal once arrived at, no matter how many instincts and interests
(the basis of all ideals) are thereby outraged in others and ultimately
also in one's self. On the other hand lies mystical disintegration,
which leads men to feel so keenly the rights of everything in particular
and of the All in general, that they retain no hearty allegiance to any
human interest. Between these two abysses winds the narrow path of
charity and valour. The ultimate ideal is absolutely authoritative,
because if any ground were found to relax allegiance to it in any degree
or for any consideration, that ground would itself be the ideal, found
to be more nearly absolute and ultimate than the one, hastily so called,
which it corrected. The ultimate ideal, in order to maintain its
finality and preclude the possibility of an appeal which should dislodge
it from its place of authority, must have taken all interests into
consideration; it must be universally representative. Now, to take an
interest into consideration and represent it means to intend, as far as
possible, to <a name="Page_216" id="Page_216" />secure the particular good which that particular interest
looks to, and never, whatever measures may be adopted, to cease to look
back on the elementary impulse as upon something which ought, if
possible, to have been satisfied, and which we should still go back and
satisfy now, if circumstances and the claims of rival interests
permitted.</p>

<p>Justice and charity are identical. To deny the initial right of any
impulse is not morality but fanaticism. However determined may be the
prohibition which reason opposes to some wild instinct, that prohibition
is never reckless; it is never inconsiderate of the very impulse which
it suppresses. It suppresses that impulse unwillingly, pitifully, under
stress of compulsion and <i>force majeure</i>; for reason, in representing
this impulse in the context of life and in relation to every other
impulse which, in its operation, it would affect mechanically, rejects
and condemns it; but it condemns it not by antecedent hate but by
supervening wisdom. The texture of the natural world, the conflict of
interests in the soul and in society, all of which cannot be satisfied
together, is accordingly the ground for moral restrictions and
compromises. Whatever the up-shot of the struggle may be, whatever the
verdict pronounced by reason, the parties to the suit must in justice
all be heard, and heard sympathetically.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Primary and secondary morality.</div>

<p>Herein lies the great difference between first-hand and second-hand
morality. The retailers <a name="Page_217" id="Page_217" />of moral truth, the town-criers that go
shouting in the streets some sentence passed long ago in reason's court
against some inadmissible desire, know nothing of justice or mercy or
reason&mdash;three principles essentially identical. They thunder conclusions
without remembering the premisses, and expose their precepts, daily, of
course, grown more thin and unrepresentative, to the aversion and
neglect of all who genuinely love what is good. The masters of life, on
the contrary, the first framers and discoverers of moral ideals, are
persons who disregard those worn conventions and their professional
interpreters: they are persons who have a fresh sense for the universal
need and cry of human souls, and reconstruct the world of duty to make
it fit better with the world of desire and of possible happiness.
Primary morality, inspired by love of something naturally good, is
accordingly charitable and ready to forgive; while secondary morality,
founded on prejudice, is fanatical and ruthless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Uncharitable pagan justice is not just.</div>

<p>As virtue carries with it a pleasure which perfects it and without which
virtue would evidently be spurious and merely compulsory, so justice
carries with it a charity which is its highest expression, without which
justice remains only an organised wrong. Of justice without charity we
have a classic illustration in Plato's Republic and in general in the
pagan world. An end is assumed, in this case <a name="Page_218" id="Page_218" />an end which involves
radical injustice toward every interest not included in it; and then an
organism is developed or conceived that shall subserve that end, and
political justice is defined as the harmonious adjustment of powers and
functions within that organism. Reason and art suffice to discover the
right methods for reaching the chosen end, and the polity thus
established, with all its severities and sacrifices of personal will, is
rationally grounded. The chosen end, however, is arbitrary, and, in
fact, perverse; for to maintain a conventional city with stable
institutions and perpetual military efficiency would not secure human
happiness; nor (to pass to the individual virtue symbolised by such a
state) would the corresponding discipline of personal habits, in the
service of vested interests and bodily life, truly unfold the
potentialities of the human spirit.</p>

<p>Plato himself, in passing, acknowledges that his political ideal is
secondary and not ideal at all, since only luxury, corruption, and
physical accidents make a military state necessary; but his absorption
in current Greek questions made him neglect the initial question of all,
namely, how a non-military and non-competitive state might be
established, or rather how the remedial functions of the state might be
forestalled by natural justice and rendered unnecessary. The violence
which such a fallen ideal, with its iniquitous virtues, does to humanity
appeared only <a name="Page_219" id="Page_219" />too clearly in the sequel, when Platonism took refuge in
the supernatural. The whole pagan world was convicted of injustice and
the cities for whose glory the greatest heroes had lived and died were
abandoned with horror. Only in a catacomb or a hermitage did there seem
to be any room for the soul. This revulsion, perverse in its own way,
expressed rightly enough the perversity of that unjust justice, those
worldly and arbitrary virtues, and that sad happiness which had enslaved
the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doom of ancient republics.</div>

<p>Plato could never have answered the question whether his Republic had a
right to exist and to brush aside all other commonwealths; he could
never have justified the ways of man to the rest of creation nor (what
is more pertinent) to man's more plastic and tenderer imagination. The
initial impulses on which his Republic is founded, which make war,
defensive and aggressive, the first business of the state, are not
irresistible impulses, they do not correspond to ultimate ends. Physical
life cannot justify itself; it cannot be made the purpose of those
rational faculties which it generates; these, on the contrary, are its
own end. The purpose of war must be peace; the purpose of competition a
more general prosperity; the purpose of personal life ideal
achievements. A polity which should not tend to abolish private lusts,
competition, and war would be an irrational polity. The organisation
which the ancients in<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220" />sisted on within each state, the sacrifices they
imposed on each class in the community for the general welfare, have to
be repeated in that greater commonwealth of which cities and nations are
citizens; for their own existence and prosperity depends on conciliating
inwardly all that may affect them and turning foreign forces, when
contact with them is inevitable, into friends. Duty and co-operation
must extend as far as do physical bonds, the function of reason being to
bring life into harmony with its conditions, so as to render it
self-perpetuating and free. This end can never be attained while the
scope of moral fellowship is narrower than that of physical interplay.
Ancient civilisation, brilliant in proportion to its inner integration,
was brief in proportion to its outer injustice. By defying the external
forces on which also a commonwealth depends, those commonwealths came to
premature extinction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rational charity.</div>

<p>There is accordingly a justice deeper and milder than that of pagan
states, a universal justice called charity, a kind of all-penetrating
courtesy, by which the limits of personal or corporate interests are
transgressed in imagination. Value is attributed to rival forms of life;
something of the intensity and narrowness inherent in the private will
is surrendered to admiration and solicitude for what is most alien and
hostile to one's self. When this imaginative expansion ends in
neutralising the will altogether, we have mysticism; but when it <a name="Page_221" id="Page_221" />serves
merely to co-ordinate felt interests with other actual interests
conceived sympathetically, and to make them converge, we have justice
and charity. Charity is nothing but a radical and imaginative justice.
So the Buddhist stretches his sympathy to all real beings and to many
imaginary monsters; so the Christian chooses for his love the diseased,
the sinful, the unlovely. His own salvation does not seem to either
complete unless every other creature also is redeemed and forgiven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its limits.</div>

<p>Such universal solicitude is rational, however, only when the beings to
which it extends are in practical efficient relations with the life that
would co-operate with theirs. In other words, charity extends only to
physical and discoverable creatures, whose destiny is interwoven
dynamically with our own. Absolute and irresponsible fancy can be the
basis of no duty. If not to take other real forces and interests into
account made classic states unstable and unjust, to take into
consideration purely imaginary forces yields a polity founded on
superstition, one unjust to those who live under it. A compromise made
with non-existent or irrelevant interests is a wrong to the real
interests on which that sacrifice is imposed gratuitously. All
sacrifices exacted by mere religion have accordingly been inhuman; at
best they have unintentionally made some amends by affording abstract
discipline or artistic forms of expression. The sacrifice must be
<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222" />fruitful in the end and bring happiness to somebody: otherwise it
cannot long remain tender or beautiful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its mythical supports.</div>

<p>Charity is seldom found uncoloured by fables which illustrate it and
lend it a motive by which it can justify itself verbally.
Metempsychosis, heaven and hell, Christ's suffering for every sinner,
are notions by which charity has often been guided and warmed. Like myth
everywhere, these notions express judgments which they do not originate,
although they may strengthen or distort them in giving them expression.
The same myths, in cruel hands, become goads to fanaticism. That natural
sensitiveness in which charity consists has many degrees and many
inequalities; the spirit bloweth where it listeth. Incidental
circumstances determine its phases and attachments in life. Christian
charity, for instance, has two chief parts: first, it hastens to relieve
the body; then, forgetting physical economy altogether, it proceeds to
redeem the soul. The bodily works of mercy which Christians perform with
so much tact and devotion are not such as philanthropy alone would
inspire; they are more and less than that. They are more, because they
are done with a certain disproportionate and absolute solicitude, quite
apart from ultimate benefit or a thought of the best distribution of
energies; they are also less, because they stop at healing, and cannot
pass beyond the remedial and incidental phase <a name="Page_223" id="Page_223" />without ceasing to be
Christian. The poor, says Christian charity, we have always with us;
every man must be a sinner&mdash;else what obligation should he have to
repent?&mdash;and, in fine, this world is essentially the kingdom of Satan.
Charity comes only to relieve the most urgent bodily needs, and then to
wean the heart altogether from mortal interests. Thus Christianity
covers the world with hospitals and orphanages; but its only positive
labours go on in churches and convents, nor will it found schools, if
left to itself, to teach anything except religion. These offices may be
performed with more or less success, with more or less appeal to the
miraculous; but, with whatever mixture of magic and policy, Christian
charity has never aimed at anything but healing the body and saving the
soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">There is intelligence in charity.</div>

<p>Christ himself, we may well feel, did not affect publicans and sinners,
ignorant people and children, in order to save them in the regimental
and prescriptive fashion adopted by the Church. He commanded those he
forgave to sin no more and those he healed to go, as custom would have
it, to the priest. He understood the bright good that each sinner was
following when he stumbled into the pit. For this insight he was loved.
To be rebuked in that sympathetic spirit was to be comforted; to be
punished by such a hand was to be made whole. The Magdalene was forgiven
because she had loved much; an absolution which <a name="Page_224" id="Page_224" />rehabilitates the
primary longing that had driven her on, a longing not insulted but
comprehended in such an absolution, and purified by that comprehension.
It is a charitable salvation which enables the newly revealed deity to
be absolutely loved. Charity has this art of making men abandon their
errors without asking them to forget their ideals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buddhist and Christian forms of it.</div>

<p>In Buddhism the same charity wears a more speculative form. All beings
are to be redeemed from the illusion which is the fountain of their
troubles. None is to be compelled to assume irrationally an alien set of
duties or other functions than his own. Spirit is not to be incarcerated
perpetually in grotesque and accidental monsters, but to be freed from
all fatality and compulsion. The goal is not some more flattering
incarnation, but escape from incarnation altogether. Ignorance is to be
enlightened, passion calmed, mistaken destiny revoked; only what the
inmost being desiderates, only what can really quiet the longings
embodied in any particular will, is to occupy the redeemed mind. Here,
though creative reason is wholly wanting, charity is truly understood;
for it avails little to make of kindness a vicarious selfishness and to
use neighbourly offices to plunge our neighbour deeper into his
favourite follies. Such servile sympathy would make men one another's
accomplices rather than friends. It would treat them with a weak
promiscuous <a name="Page_225" id="Page_225" />favour, not with true mercy and justice. In charity there
can be nothing to repent of, as there so often is in natural love and in
partisan propaganda. Christians have sometimes interpreted charity as
zeal to bring men into their particular fold; or, at other times, when
enthusiasm for doctrine and institutes has cooled, they have interpreted
charity to be mere blind co-operation, no matter in what.</p>

<p>The Buddhists seem to have shown a finer sense in their ministry,
knowing how to combine universal sympathy with perfect spirituality.
There was no brow-beating in their call to conversion, no new tyranny
imposed of sanctioned by their promised deliverance. If they could not
rise to a positive conception of natural life, this inability but marks
the well-known limitations of Oriental fancy, which has never been able
to distinguish steadily that imagination which rests on and expresses
material life from that which, in its import, breaks loose from the
given conditions of life altogether, and is therefore monstrous and
dreamful. But at least Buddhism knew how to sound the heart and pierce
to the genuine principles of happiness and misery. If it did not venture
to interpret reason positively, it at least forbore to usurp its inward
and autonomous authority, and did not set up, in the name of salvation,
some new partiality, some new principle of distress and illusion. In
destroying worldliness this religion avoided imposture. The <a name="Page_226" id="Page_226" />clearing it
made in the soul was soon overgrown again by the inexorable Indian
jungle; but had a virile intellect been at hand, it would have been free
to raise something solid and rational in the space so happily swept
clean of all accumulated rubbish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Apparent division of the spiritual and the natural.</div>

<p>Against avarice, lust, and rancour, against cruel and vain national
ambitions, tenderer and more recollected minds have always sought some
asylum: but they have the seldom possessed enough knowledge of nature
and of human life to distinguish clearly the genuine and innocent goods
which they longed for, and their protest against &quot;the world&quot; has too
often taken on a mystical and irrational accent. Charity, for instance,
in its profounder deliverances, has become a protest against the
illusion of personality; whereby existence and action seem to be wholly
condemned after their principle has been identified with selfishness. An
artificial puzzle is thus created, the same concept, selfishness or an
irrational partiality and injustice in the will, being applied to two
principles of action, the one wrong and the other necessary. Every man
is necessarily the seat of his own desires, which, if truly fulfilled,
would bring him satisfaction; but the objects in which that satisfaction
may be found, and the forces that must co-operate to secure it, lie far
afield, and his life will remain cramped and self-destructive so long as
he does not envisage its <a name="Page_227" id="Page_227" />whole basis and co-operate with all his
potential allies.</p>

<p>The rationality which would then be attained is so immensely exalted
above the microscopic vision and punctiform sensibility of those who
think themselves practical, that speculative natures seem to be
proclaiming another set of interests, another and quite miraculous life,
when they attempt to thaw out and vivify the vulgar mechanism; and the
sense of estrangement and contradiction often comes over the spiritually
minded themselves, making them confess sadly that the kingdom of heaven
is not of this world. As common morality itself falls easily into
mythical expressions and speaks of a fight between conscience and
nature, reason and the passions, as if these were independent in their
origin or could be divided in their operation, so spiritual life even
more readily opposes the ideal to the real, the revealed and heavenly
truth to the extant reality, as if the one could be anything but an
expression and fulfilment of the other. Being equal convinced that
spiritual life is authoritative and possible, and that it is opposed to
all that earthly experience has as yet supplied, the prophet almost
inevitably speaks of another world above the clouds and another
existence beyond the grave; he thus seeks to clothe in concrete and
imaginable form the ideal to which natural existence seems to him wholly
rebellious. Spiritual life comes to mean life abstracted from politics,
from art, from <a name="Page_228" id="Page_228" />sense, even in the end from morality. Natural motives
and natural virtues are contrasted with those which are henceforth
called supernatural, and all the grounds and sanctions of right living
are transferred to another life. A doctrine of immortality thus becomes
the favourite expression of religion. By its variations and greater or
less transparency and ideality we can measure the degree of spiritual
insight which has been reached at any moment.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>THE BELIEF IN A FUTURE LIFE</p>


<div class="sidenote">The length of life a subject for natural science.</div>

<p>At no point are the two ingredients of religion, superstition and moral
truth, more often confused than in the doctrine of immortality, yet in
none are they more clearly distinguishable. Ideal immortality is a
principle revealed to insight; it is seen by observing the eternal
quality of ideas and validities, and the affinity to them native to
reason or the cognitive energy of mind. A future life, on the contrary,
is a matter for faith or presumption; it is a prophetic hypothesis
regarding occult existences. This latter question is scientific and
empirical, and should be treated as such. A man is, forensically
speaking, the same man after the nightly break in his consciousness.
After many changes in his body and after long oblivion, parcels of his
youth may be revived and may come to figure again among the factors in
his action. Similarly, if evidence to that effect were available, we
might establish the resurrection of a given soul in new bodies or its
activity in remote places and times. Evidence <a name="Page_230" id="Page_230" />of this sort has in fact
always been offered copiously by rumour and superstition. The operation
of departed spirits, like that of the gods, has been recognised in many
a dream, or message, or opportune succour. The Dioscuri and Saint James
the Apostle have appeared&mdash;preferably on white horses&mdash;in sundry
battles. Spirits duly invoked have repeated forgotten gossip and
revealed the places where crimes had been committed or treasure buried.
More often, perhaps, ghosts have walked the night without any ostensible
or useful purpose, apparently in obedience to some ghastly compulsion
that crept over them in death, as if a hesitating sickle had left them
still hanging to life by one attenuated fibre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">&quot;Psychical&quot; phenomena.</div>

<p>The mass of this evidence, ancient and modern, traditional and
statistical, is beneath consideration; the palpitating mood in which it
is gathered and received, even when ostensibly scientific, is such that
gullibility and fiction play a very large part in the report; for it is
not to be assumed that a man, because he speaks in the first person and
addresses a learned society, has lost the primordial faculty of lying.
When due allowance has been made, however, for legend and fraud, there
remains a certain residuum of clairvoyance and telepathy, and an
occasional abnormal obedience of matter to mind which might pass for
magic. There are unmistakable indications that in these regions we touch
lower and more rudimentary faculties. There seems to <a name="Page_231" id="Page_231" />be, as is quite
natural, a sub-human sensibility in man, wherein ideas are connected
together by bonds so irrational and tenacious that they seem miraculous
to a mind already trained in practical and relevant thinking. This
sub-human sense, far from representing important truths more clearly
than ordinary apprehension can, reduces consciousness again to a tangle
of trivial impressions, shots of uncertain range, as if a skin had not
yet formed over the body. It emerges in tense and disorganised moments.
Its reports are the more trifling the more startingly literal their
veracity. It seems to represent a stratum of life beneath moral or
intellectual functions, and beneath all personality. When proof has been
found that a ghost has actually been seen, proof is required that the
phantom has been rightly recognised and named; and this imputed identity
is never demonstrable and in most cases impossible. So in the magic
cures which from time immemorial have been recorded at shrines of all
religions, and which have been attributed to wonder-workers of every
sect: the one thing certain about them is that they prove neither the
truth of whatever myth is capriciously associated with them, nor the
goodness or voluntary power of the miracle-worker himself. Healer and
medium are alike vehicles for some elemental energy they cannot control,
and which as often as not misses fire; at best they feel a power going
out of them which they themselves undergo, and <a name="Page_232" id="Page_232" />which radiates from them
like electricity, to work, as chance will have it, good or evil in the
world. The whole operation lies, in so far as it really takes place at
all, on the lowest levels of unintelligence, in a region closely allied
to madness in consciousness and to sporadic organic impulses in the
physical sphere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hypertrophies of sense.</div>

<p>Among the blind, the retina having lost its function, the rest of the
skin is said to recover its primordial sensitiveness to distance and
light, so that the sightless have a clearer premonition of objects about
them than seeing people could have in the dark. So when reason and the
ordinary processes of sense are in abeyance a certain universal
sensibility seems to return to the soul; influences at other times not
appreciable make then a sensible impression, and automatic reactions may
be run through in response to a stimulus normally quite insufficient.
Now the complexity of nature is prodigious; everything that happens
leaves, like buried cities, almost indelible traces which an eye, by
chance attentive and duly prepared, can manage to read, recovering for a
moment the image of an extinct life. Symbols, illegible to reason, can
thus sometimes read themselves out in trance and madness. Faint vestiges
may be found in matter of forms which it once wore, or which, like a
perfume, impregnated and got lodgment within it. Slight echoes may
suddenly reconstitute themselves in the mind's silence; and a
half-<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233" />stunned consciousness may catch brief glimpses of long-lost and
irrelevant things. Real ghosts are such reverberations of the past,
exceeding ordinary imagination and discernment both in vividness and in
fidelity; they may not be explicable without appealing to material
influences subtler than those ordinarily recognised, as they are
obviously not discoverable without some derangement and hypertrophy of
the senses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">These possibilities affect physical existence only.</div>

<p>That such subtler influences should exist is entirely consonant with
reason and experience; but only a hankering tenderness for superstition,
a failure to appreciate the function both of religion and of science,
can lead to reverence for such oracular gibberish as these influences
provoke. The world is weary of experimenting with magic. In utter
seriousness and with immense solemnity whole races have given themselves
up to exploiting these shabby mysteries; and while a new survey of the
facts, in the light of natural science and psychology, is certainly not
superfluous, it can be expected to lead to nothing but a more detailed
and conscientious description of natural processes. The thought of
employing such investigations to save at the last moment religious
doctrines founded on moral ideas is a pathetic blunder; the obscene
supernatural has nothing to do with rational religion. If it were
discovered that wretched echoes of a past life could be actually heard
by putting one's ear long <a name="Page_234" id="Page_234" />enough to a tomb, and if (<i>per impossibile</i>)
those echoes could be legitimately attributed to another mind, and to
the very mind, indeed, whose former body was interred there, a
melancholy chapter would indeed be added to man's earthly fortunes,
since it would appear that even after death he retained, under certain
conditions, a fatal attachment to his dead body and to the other
material instruments of his earthly life. Obviously such a discovery
would teach us more about dying than about immortality; the truths
disclosed, since they would be disclosed by experiment and observation,
would be psycho-physical truths, implying nothing about what a truly
disembodied life might be, if one were attainable; for a disembodied
life could by no possibility betray itself in spectres, rumblings, and
spasms. Actual thunders from Sinai and an actual discovery of two stone
tables would have been utterly irrelevant to the moral authority of the
ten commandments or to the existence of a truly supreme being. No less
irrelevant to a supramundane immortality is the length of time during
which human spirits may be condemned to operate on earth after their
bodies are quiet. In other words, spectral survivals would at most
enlarge our conception of the soul's physical basis, spreading out the
area of its manifestations; they could not possibly, seeing the
survivals are physical, reveal the disembodied existence of the soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral grounds for the doctrine. The necessary assumption of a
future.</div>

<p>Such a disembodied existence, removed by its <a name="Page_235" id="Page_235" />nature from the sphere of
empirical evidence, might nevertheless be actual, and grounds of a moral
or metaphysical type might be sought for postulating its reality. Life
and the will to live are at bottom identical. Experience itself is
transitive and can hardly arise apart from a forward effort and
prophetic apprehension by which adjustments are made to a future
unmistakably foreseen. This premonition, by which action seeks to
justify and explain itself to reflection, may be analysed into a group
of memories and sensations of movement, generating ideal expectations
which might easily be disappointed; but scepticism about the future can
hardly be maintained in the heat of action. A postulate acted on is an
act of genuine and dogmatic faith. I not only postulate a morrow when I
prepare for it, but ingenuously and heartily believe that the morrow
will come. This faith does not amount to certitude; I may confess, if
challenged, that before to-morrow I and the world and time itself might
conceivably come to an end together; but that idle possibility, so long
as it does not slacken action, will not disturb belief. Every moment of
life accordingly trusts that life will continue; and this prophetic
interpretation of action, so long as action lasts, amounts to continual
faith in futurity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An assumption no evidence.</div>

<p>A sophist might easily transform this psychological necessity into a
dazzling proof of immor<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236" />tality. To believe anything, he might say, is to
be active; but action involves faith in a future and in the fruits of
action; and as no living moment can be without this confidence, belief
in extinction would be self-contradictory and at no moment a possible
belief. The question, however, is not whether every given moment has or
has not a specious future before it to which it looks forward, but
whether the realisation of such foresight, a realisation which during
waking life is roughly usual, is incapable of failing. Now expectation,
never without its requisite antecedents and natural necessity, often
lacks fulfilment, and never finds its fulfilment entire; so that the
necessity of a postulate gives no warrant for its verification.
Expectation and action are constantly suspended together; and what
happens whenever thought loses itself or stumbles, what happens whenever
in its shifts it forgets its former objects, might well happen at
crucial times to that train of intentions which we call a particular
life or the life of humanity. The prophecy involved in action is not
insignificant, but it is notoriously fallible and depends for its
fulfilment on external conditions. The question accordingly really is
whether a man expecting to live for ever or one expecting to die in his
time has the more representative and trustworthy notion of the future.
The question, so stated, cannot be solved by an appeal to evidence,
which is necessarily all on <a name="Page_237" id="Page_237" />one side, but only by criticising the value
of evidence as against instinct and hope, and by ascertaining the
relative status which assumption and observation have in experience.</p>

<p>The transcendental compulsion under which action labours of envisaging a
future, and the animal instinct that clings to life and flees from death
as the most dreadful of evils are the real grounds why immortality seems
initially natural and good. Confidence in living for ever is anterior to
the discovery that all men are mortal and to the discovery that the
thinker is himself a man. These discoveries flatly contradict that
confidence, in the form in which it originally presents itself, and all
doctrines of immortality which adult philosophy can entertain are more
or less subterfuges and after-thoughts by which the observed fact of
mortality and the native inconceivability of death are more or less
clumsily reconciled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A solipsistic argument.</div>

<p>The most lordly and genuine fashion of asserting immortality would be to
proclaim one's self an exception to the animal race and to point out
that the analogy between one's singular self and others is altogether
lame and purely conventional. Any proud barbarian, with a tincture of
transcendental philosophy, might adopt this tone. &quot;Creatures that
perish,&quot; he might say, &quot;are and can be nothing but puppets and painted
shadows in my mind. My conscious will forbids its own extinction; it
scorns to level <a name="Page_238" id="Page_238" />itself with its own objects and instruments. The world,
which I have never known to exist without me, exists by my co-operation
and consent; it can never extinguish what lends it being. The death
prophetically accepted by weaklings, with such small insight and
courage, I mock and altogether defy: it can never touch me.&quot;</p>

<p>Such solipsistic boasts may not have been heard in historic times from
the lips of men speaking in their own persons. Language has an
irresistible tendency to make thought communistic and ideally
transferable to others. It forbids a man to say of himself what it would
be ridiculous to hear from another. Now solipsism in another man is a
comic thing: and a mind, prompted perhaps by hell and heaven to speak
solipsistically, is stopped by the laughable echo of its own words, when
it remembers its bold sayings. Language, being social, resists a virgin
egotism and forbids it to express itself publicly, no matter how well
grounded it may be in transcendental logic and in animal instinct.
Social convention is necessarily materialistic, since the beginning of
all moral reasonableness consists in taming the transcendental conceit
native to a living mind, in attaching it to its body, and bringing the
will that thought itself absolute down to the rank of animals and men.
Otherwise no man would acknowledge another's rights or even conceive his
existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Absoluteness and immortality transferred to the gods.</div>

<p>Primeval solipsism&mdash;the philosophy of untamed <a name="Page_239" id="Page_239" />animal will&mdash;has
accordingly taken to the usual by-paths and expressed itself openly only
in myth or by a speculative abstraction in which the transcendental
spirit, for which all the solipsistic privileges were still claimed, was
distinguished from the human individual. The gods, it was said, were
immortal; and although on earth spirit must submit to the yoke and
service of matter, on whose occasions it must wait, yet there existed in
the ether other creatures more normally and gloriously compounded, since
their forms served and expressed their minds, which ruled also over the
elements and feared no assault from time. With the advent of this
mythology experience and presumption divided their realms; experience
was allowed to shape men's notions of vulgar reality, but presumption,
which could not be silenced, was allowed to suggest a second sphere,
thinly and momentarily veiled to mortal sense, in which the premonitions
of will were abundantly realised.</p>

<p>This expedient had the advantage of endowing the world with creatures
that really satisfied human aspirations, such as at any moment they
might be. The gods possessed longevity, beauty, magic celerity of
movement, leisure, splendour of life, indefinite strength, and practical
omniscience. When the gods were also expressions for natural forces,
this function somewhat prejudiced their ideality, and they failed to
correspond per<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240" />fectly to what their worshippers would have most
esteemed; but religious reformers tended to expunge naturalism from
theology and to represent the gods as entirely admirable. The Greek
gods, to be sure, always continued to have genealogies, and the fact of
having been born is a bad augury for immortality; but other religions,
and finally the Greek philosophers themselves, conceived unbegotten
gods, in whom the human rebellion against mutability was expressed
absolutely.</p>

<p>Thus a place was found in nature for the constant and perpetual element
which crude experience seems to contain or at least to suggest.
Unfortunately the immortal and the human were in this mythology wholly
divorced, so that while immortality was vindicated for something in the
universe it was emphatically denied to man and to his works.
Contemplation, to be satisfied with this situation, had to be heroically
unselfish and resigned; the gods' greatness and glory had to furnish
sufficient solace for all mortal defeats. At the same time all criticism
had to be deprecated, for reflection would at once have pointed out that
the divine life in question was either a personification of natural
processes and thus really in flux and full of oblivion and imperfection,
or else a hypostasis of certain mental functions and ideals, which could
not really be conceived apart from the natural human life which they
informed and from which they had been violently abstracted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241" />Or to a divine principle in all beings.</div>

<p>Another expedient was accordingly found, especially by mystics and
critical philosophers, for uniting the mortal and immortal in existence
while still distinguishing them in essence. <i>Cur Deus Homo</i> might be
said to be the theme of all such speculations. Plato had already found
the eternal in the form which the temporal puts on, or, if the phrase be
preferred, had seen in the temporal and existential nothing but an
individuated case of the ideal. The soul was immortal, unbegotten,
impassible; the bodies it successively inhabited and the experience it
gathered served merely to bring out its nature with greater or less
completeness. To somewhat the same effect the German transcendentalists
identified and distinguished the private and the universal spirit. What
lived in each man and in each moment was the Absolute&mdash;for nothing else
could really exist&mdash;and the expression which the Absolute there took on
was but a transitional phase of its total self-expression, which, could
it be grasped in its totality, would no longer seem subject to
contradiction and flux. An immortal agent therefore went through an
infinite series of acts, each transitory and relative to the others, but
all possessed of inalienable reality and eternal significance. In such
formulations the divorce was avoided between the intellectual and the
sensuous factor in experience&mdash;a divorce which the myth about immortal
gods and mortal men had introduced. On <a name="Page_242" id="Page_242" />the other hand existential
immortality was abandoned; only an ideal permanence, only significance,
was allowed to any finite being, and the better or future world of which
ancient poets had dreamt, Olympus, and every other heaven, was
altogether abolished. There was an eternal universe where everything was
transitory and a single immortal spirit at no two moments the same. The
world of idealism realised no particular ideal, and least of all the
ideal of a natural and personal immunity from death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In neither case is the individual immortal.</div>

<p>First, then, a man may refuse to admit that he must die at all; then,
abashed at the arrogance of that assertion, he may consider the immortal
life of other creatures, like the earth and stars, which seem subject to
no extinction, and he may ascribe to these a perpetual consciousness and
personality. Finally, confessing the fabulous character of those
deities, he may distinguish an immortal agent or principle within
himself, identify it with the inner principle of all other beings, and
contrast it with its varying and conditioned expressions. But scarcely
is this abstraction attained when he must perceive its worthlessness,
since the natural life, the concrete aims, and the personal career which
immortality was intended to save from dissolution are wholly alien to a
nominal entity which endures through all change, however fundamental,
and cohabits with every nature, however hostile and odious to humanity.
If immor<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243" />tality is to be genuine, what is immortal must be something
definite, and if this immortality is to concern life and not mere
significance or ideal definition, that which endures must be an
individual creature with a fixed nucleus of habits and demands, so that
its persistence may contain progress and achievement.</p>

<p>Herewith we may dismiss the more direct attempts to conceive and assert
a future life. Their failure drives us to a consideration of indirect
attempts to establish an unobservable but real immortality through
revelation and dogma. Such an immortality would follow on transmigration
or resurrection, and would be assigned to a supernatural sphere, a
second empirical world present to the soul after death, where her
fortunes would not be really conceivable without a reconstituted body
and a new material environment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Possible forms of survival.</div>

<p>Many a man dies too soon and some are born in the wrong age or station.
Could these persons drink at the fountain of youth at least once more
they might do themselves fuller justice and cut a better figure at last
in the universe. Most people think they have stuff in them for greater
things than time suffers them to perform. To imagine a second career is
a pleasing antidote for ill-fortune; the poor soul wants another chance.
But how should a future life be constituted if it is to satisfy this
demand, and how long need it last? It would evidently have to go on in
an environment closely <a name="Page_244" id="Page_244" />analogous to earth; I could not, for instance,
write in another world the epics which the necessity of earning my
living may have stifled here, did that other world contain no time, no
heroic struggles, or no metrical language. Nor is it clear that my
epics, to be perfect, would need to be quite endless. If what is foiled
in me is really poetic genius and not simply a tendency toward perpetual
motion, it would not help me if in heaven, in lieu of my dreamt-of
epics, I were allowed to beget several robust children. In a word, if
hereafter I am to be the same man improved I must find myself in the
same world corrected. Were I transformed into a cherub or transported
into a timeless ecstasy, it is hard to see in what sense I should
continue to exist. Those results might be interesting in themselves and
might enrich the universe; they would not prolong my life nor retrieve
my disasters.</p>

<p>For this reason a future life is after all best represented by those
frankly material ideals which most Christians&mdash;being Platonists&mdash;are
wont to despise. It would be genuine happiness for a Jew to rise again
in the flesh and live for ever in Ezekiel's New Jerusalem, with its
ceremonial glories and civic order. It would be truly agreeable for any
man to sit in well-watered gardens with Mohammed, clad in green silks,
drinking delicious sherbets, and transfixed by the gazelle-like glance
of some young girl, all innocence and fire. Amid such scenes a man might
remain himself <a name="Page_245" id="Page_245" />and might fulfil hopes that he had actually cherished on
earth. He might also find his friends again, which in somewhat generous
minds is perhaps the thought that chiefly sustains interest in a
posthumous existence. But to recognise his friends a man must find them
in their bodies, with their familiar habits, voices, and interests; for
it is surely an insult to affection to say that he could find them in an
eternal formula expressing their idiosyncrasy. When, however, it is
clearly seen that another life, to supplement this one, must closely
resemble it, does not the magic of immortality altogether vanish? Is
such a reduplication of earthly society at all credible? And the
prospect of awakening again among houses and trees, among children and
dotards, among wars and rumours of wars, still fettered to one
personality and one accidental past, still uncertain of the future, is
not this prospect wearisome and deeply repulsive? Having passed through
these things once and bequeathed them to posterity, is it not time for
each soul to rest? The universe doubtless contains all sorts of
experiences, better and worse than the human; but it is idle to
attribute to a particular man a life divorced from his circumstances and
from his body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arguments from retribution and need of opportunity.</div>

<p>Dogmas about such a posthumous experience find some shadowy support in
various illusions and superstitions that surround death, but they are
developed into articulate prophecies chiefly by certain moral <a name="Page_246" id="Page_246" />demands.
One of these requires rewards and punishments more emphatic and sure
than those which conduct meets with in this world. Another requires
merely a more favourable and complete opportunity for the soul's
development. Considerations like these are pertinent to moral
philosophy. It touches the notion of duty whether an exact hedonistic
retribution is to be demanded for what is termed merit and guilt: so
that without such supernatural remuneration virtue, perhaps, would be
discredited and deprived of a motive. It likewise touches the ideality
and nobleness of life whether human aims can be realised satisfactorily
only in the agent's singular person, so that the fruits of effort would
be forth-with missed if the labourer himself should disappear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ignoble temper of both.</div>

<p>To establish justice in the world and furnish an adequate incentive to
virtue was once thought the chief business of a future life. The Hebraic
religions somewhat overreached themselves on these points: for the
grotesque alternative between hell and heaven in the end only aggravated
the injustice it was meant to remedy. Life is unjust in that it
subordinates individuals to a general mechanical law, and the deeper and
longer hold fate has on the soul, the greater that injustice. A
perpetual life would be a perpetual subjection to arbitrary power, while
a last judgment would be but a last fatality. That hell may have
fright<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247" />ened a few villains into omitting a crime is perhaps credible;
but the embarrassed silence which the churches, in a more sensitive age,
prefer to maintain on that wholesome doctrine&mdash;once, as they taught, the
only rational basis for virtue&mdash;shows how their teaching has to follow
the independent progress of morals. Nevertheless, persons are not
wanting, apparently free from ecclesiastical constraint, who still
maintain that the value of life depends on its indefinite prolongation.
By an artifice of reflection they substitute vanity for reason, and
selfish for ingenuous instincts in man. Being apparently interested in
nothing but their own careers, they forget that a man may remember how
little he counts in the world and suffer that rational knowledge to
inspire his purposes. Intense morality has always envisaged earthly
goods and evils, and even when a future life has been accepted vaguely,
it has never given direction to human will or aims, which at best it
could only proclaim more emphatically. It may indeed be said that no man
of any depth of soul has made his prolonged existence the touchstone of
his enthusiasms. Such an instinct is carnal, and if immortality is to
add a higher inspiration to life it must not be an immortality of
selfishness. What a despicable creature must a man be, and how sunk
below the level of the most barbaric virtue, if he cannot bear to live
for his children, for his art, or for country!</p>

<div class="sidenote">False optimistic postulate involved.</div>

<p>To turn these moral questions, however, into <a name="Page_248" id="Page_248" />arguments for a physical
speculation, like that about human longevity, resurrection, or
metempsychosis, a hybrid principle is required: thus, even if we have
answered those moral questions in the conventional way and satisfied
ourselves that personal immortality is a postulate of ethics, we cannot
infer that immortality therefore exists unless we import into the
argument a tremendous optimistic postulate, to the effect that what is
requisite for moral rationality must in every instance be realised in
experience.</p>

<p>Such an optimistic postulate, however, as the reader must have
repeatedly observed, is made not only despite all experience but in
ignorance of the conditions under which alone ideals are framed and
retain their significance. Every ideal expresses individual and specific
tendencies, proper at some moment to some natural creature; every ideal
therefore has for its basis a part only of the dynamic world, so that
its fulfilment is problematical and altogether adventitious to its
existence and authority. To decide whether an ideal can be or will be
fulfilled we must examine the physical relation between such organic
forces as that ideal expresses and the environment in which those forces
operate; we may then perceive how far a realisation of the given aims is
possible, how far it must fail, and how far the aims in question, by a
shift in their natural basis, will lapse and yield to others, possibly
more capable <a name="Page_249" id="Page_249" />of execution and more stable in the world. The question of
success is a question of physics. To say that an ideal will be
inevitably fulfilled simply because it is an ideal is to say something
gratuitous and foolish. Pretence cannot in the end avail against
experience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transition to ideality.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, it is important to define ideals even before their
realisation is known to be possible, because they constitute one of the
two factors whose interaction and adjustment is moral life, factors
which are complementary and diverse in function and may be independently
ascertained. The value of existences is wholly borrowed from their
ideality, without direct consideration of their fate, while the
existence of ideals is wholly determined by natural forces, without
direct relation to their fulfilment. Existence and ideal value can
therefore be initially felt and observed apart, although of course a
complete description would lay bare physical necessity in the ideals
entertained and inevitable ideal harmonies among the facts discovered.
Human life, lying as it does in the midst of a larger process, will
surely not be without some congruity with the universe. Every creature
lends potential values to a world in which it can satisfy some at least
of its demands and learn, perhaps, to modify the others. Happiness is
always a natural and an essentially possible thing, and a total despair,
since it ignores those goods which are attainable, can express only a
partial experience. <a name="Page_250" id="Page_250" />But before considering in what ways a disciplined
soul might make its peace with reality, we may consider what an
undisciplined soul in the first instance desires; and from this
starting-point we may trace her chastening and education, observing the
ideal compensations which may console her for lost illusions.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>IDEAL IMMORTALITY</p>


<div class="sidenote">Olympian immortality the first ideal.</div>

<p>In order to give the will to live frank and direct satisfaction, it
would have been necessary to solve the problem of perpetual motion in
the animal body, as nature has approximately solved it in the solar
system. Nutrition should have continually repaired all waste, so that
the cycle of youth and age might have repeated itself yearly in every
individual, like summer and winter on the earth. Nor are some hints of
such an equilibrium altogether wanting. Convalescence, sudden good
fortune, a belated love, and even the April sunshine or morning air,
bring about a certain rejuvenescence in man prophetic of what is not
ideally impossible&mdash;perpetuity and constant reinforcement in his vital
powers. Had nature furnished the elixir of life, or could art have
discovered it, the whole face of human society would have been changed.
The earth once full, no more children would have been begotten and
parental instincts would have been atrophied for want of function. All
men would have been contemporaries and, having all time before them for
travel and experiment, would have allied themselves eventually with what
was most congenial to <a name="Page_252" id="Page_252" />them and would have come to be bound only by free
and friendly ties. They would all have been well known and would have
acted perpetually in their ultimate and true character, like the
immortal gods. One might have loved fixity, like Hestia, and another
motion, like Hermes; a third might have been untiring in the plastic
arts, like Heph&aelig;stus, or, like Apollo, in music; while the infinite
realms of mathematics and philosophy would have lain open to spirits of
a quality not represented in Homer's pantheon.</p>

<p>That man's primary and most satisfying ideal is something of this sort
is clear in itself, and attested by mythology; for the great use of the
gods is that they interpret the human heart to us, and help us, while we
conceive them, to discover our inmost ambition and, while we emulate
them, to pursue it. Christian fancy, because of its ascetic meagreness
and fear of life, has not known how to fill out the picture of heaven
and has left it mystical and vague; but whatever paradise it has
ventured to imagine has been modelled on the same primary ideal. It has
represented a society of eternal beings among which there was no
marriage nor giving in marriage and where each found his congenial
mansion and that perfected activity which brings inward peace.</p>

<p>After this easy fashion were death and birth conquered in the myths,
which truly interpreted the will to live according to its primary
intention, but in reality such direct satisfaction was impossi<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253" />ble. A
total defeat, on the other hand, would have extinguished the will itself
and obliterated every human impulse seeking expression. Man's existence
is proof enough that nature was not altogether unpropitious, but
offered, in an unlooked-for direction, some thoroughfare to the soul.
Roundabout imperfect methods were discovered by which something at least
of what was craved might be secured. The individual perished, yet not
without having segregated and detached a certain portion of himself
capable of developing a second body and mind. The potentialities of this
seminal portion, having been liberated long after the parent body had
begun to feel the shock of the world, could reach full expression after
the parent body had begun to decay; and the offspring needed not itself
to succumb before it had launched a third generation. A cyclical life or
arrested death, a continual motion by little successive explosions,
could thus establish itself and could repeat from generation to
generation a process not unlike nutrition; only that, while in nutrition
the individual form remains and the inner substance is renewed
insensibly, in reproduction the form is renewed openly and the inner
substance is insensibly continuous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its indirect attainment by reproduction.</div>

<p>Reproduction seems, from the will's point of view, a marvellous
expedient involving a curious mixture of failure and success. The
individual, who alone is the seat and principle of will, is thereby
sacrificed, <a name="Page_254" id="Page_254" />so that reproduction is no response to his original hopes
and aspirations; yet in a double way he is enticed and persuaded to be
almost satisfied: first, in that so like a counterfeit of himself
actually survives, a creature to which all his ideal interests may be
transmitted; and secondly, because a new and as it were a rival aim is
now insinuated into his spirit. For the impulse toward reproduction has
now become no less powerful, even if less constant, than the impulse
toward nutrition; in other words, the will to live finds itself in the
uncongenial yet inevitable company of the will to have an heir.
Reproduction thus partly entertains the desire to be immortal by giving
it a vicarious fulfilment, and partly cancels it by adding an impulse
and joy which, when you think of it, accepts mortality. For love,
whether sexual, parental, or fraternal, is essentially sacrificial, and
prompts a man to give his life for his friends. In thus losing his life
gladly he in a sense finds it anew, since it has now become a part of
his function and ideal to yield his place to others and to live
afterwards only in them. While the primitive and animal side of him may
continue to cling to existence at all hazards and to find the thought of
extinction intolerable, his reason and finer imagination will build a
new ideal on reality better understood, and be content that the future
he looks to should be enjoyed by others. When we consider such a natural
transformation and discipline of the will, when we catch even a slight
glimpse of nature's resources <a name="Page_255" id="Page_255" />and mysteries, how thin and verbal those
belated hopes must seem which would elude death and abolish sacrifice!
Such puerile dreams not only miss the whole pathos of human life, but
ignore those specifically mortal virtues which might console us for not
being so radiantly divine as we may at first have thought ourselves.
Nature, in denying us perennial youth, has at least invited us to become
unselfish and noble.</p>

<p>A first shift in aspiration, a capacity for radical altruism, thus
supervenes upon the lust to live and accompanies parental and social
interests. The new ideal, however, can never entirely obliterate the old
and primary one, because the initial functions which the old Adam
exclusively represented remain imbedded in the new life, and are its
physical basis. If the nutritive soul ceased to operate, the
reproductive soul could never arise; to be altruistic we must first be,
and spiritual interests can never abolish or cancel the material
existence on which they are grafted. The consequence is that death, even
when circumvented by reproduction and relieved by surviving impersonal
interests, remains an essential evil. It may be accepted as inevitable,
and the goods its intrusion leaves standing may be heartily appreciated
and pursued; but something pathetic and incomplete will always attach to
a life that looks to its own termination.</p>

<p>The effort of physical existence is not to accomplish anything definite
but merely to persist for ever. The will has its first law of motion,
corre<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256" />sponding to that of matter; its initial tendency is to continue to
operate in the given direction and in the given manner. Inertia is, in
this sense, the essence of vitality. To be driven from that perpetual
course is somehow to be checked, and an external and hostile force is
required to change a habit or an instinct as much as to deflect a star.
Indeed, nutrition itself, hunting, feeding, and digestion, are forced
activities, and the basis of passions not altogether congenial nor
ideal. Hunger is an incipient faintness and agony, and an animal that
needs to hunt, gnaw, and digest is no immortal, free, or essentially
victorious creature. His will is already driven into by-paths and
expedients; his primitive beatific vision has to be interrupted by
remedial action to restore it for a while, since otherwise it would
obviously degenerate rapidly through all stages of distress until its
total extinction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral acceptance of this compromise.</div>

<p>The tasks thus imposed upon the protoplasmic will raise it, we may say,
to a higher level; to hunt is better sport, and more enlightening, than
to lie imbibing sunshine and air; and to eat is, we may well think, a
more positive and specific pleasure than merely to be. Such judgments,
however, show a human bias. They arise from incapacity to throw off
acquired organs. Those necessities which have led to the forms of life
which we happen to exemplify, and in terms of which our virtues are
necessarily expressed, seem to us, in retrospect, happy necessi<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257" />ties,
since without them our conventional goods would not have come to appeal
to us. These conventional goods, however, are only compromises with
evil, and the will would never have taken to pursuing them if it had not
been dislodged and beaten back from its primary aims. Even food is, for
this reason, no absolute blessing; it is only the first and most
necessary of comforts, of restorations, of truces and reprieves in that
battle with death in which an ultimate defeat is too plainly inevitable;
for the pitcher that goes often to the well is at last broken, and a
creature that is forced to resist his inward collapse by adventitious
aids will some day find that these aids have failed him, and that inward
dissolution has become, for some mechanical reason, quite irresistible.
It is therefore not only the lazy or mystical will that chafes at the
need of material supports and deprecates anxieties about the morrow; the
most conventional and passionate mind, when it attains any refinement,
confesses the essential servitude involved in such preoccupations by
concealing or ignoring them as much as may be. We study to eat as if we
were not ravenous, to win as if we were willing to lose, and to treat
personal wants in general as merely compulsory and uninteresting
matters. Why dwell, we say to ourselves, on our stammerings and
failures? The intent is all, and the bungling circumlocutions we may be
driven to should be courteously ignored, like a stammerer's troubles,
when once our meaning has been conveyed.</p>

<p><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258" />Even animal passions are, in this way, after-thoughts and expedients,
and although in a brutal age they seem to make up the whole of life,
later it appears that they would be gladly enough outgrown, did the
material situation permit it. Intellectual life returns, in its freedom,
to the attitude proper to primitive will, except that through the new
machinery underlying reason a more stable equilibrium has been
established with external forces, and the freedom originally absolute
has become relative to certain underlying adjustments, adjustments which
may be ignored but cannot be abandoned with impunity. Original action,
as seen in the vegetable, is purely spontaneous. On the animal level
instrumental action is added and chiefly attended to, so that the
creature, without knowing what it lives for, finds attractive tasks and
a sort of glory in the chase, in love, and in labour. In the Life of
Reason this instrumental activity is retained, for it is a necessary
basis for human prosperity and power, but the value of life is again
sought in the supervening free activity which that adjustment to
physical forces, or dominion over them, has made possible on a larger
scale. Every free activity would gladly persist for ever; and if any be
found that involves and aims at its own arrest or transformation, that
activity is thereby proved to be instrumental and servile, imposed from
without and not ideal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Even vicarious immortality intrinsically impossible.</div>

<p>Not only is man's original effort aimed at living <a name="Page_259" id="Page_259" />for ever in his own
person, but, even if he could renounce that desire, the dream of being
represented perpetually by posterity is no less doomed. Reproduction,
like nutrition, is a device not ultimately successful. If extinction
does not defeat it, evolution will. Doubtless the fertility of whatever
substance may have produced us will not be exhausted in this single
effort; a potentiality that has once proved efficacious and been
actualised in life, though it should sleep, will in time revive again.
In some form and after no matter what intervals, nature may be expected
always to possess consciousness. But beyond this planet and apart from
the human race, experience is too little imaginable to be interesting.
No definite plan or ideal of ours can find its realisation except in
ourselves. Accordingly, a vicarious physical immortality always remains
an unsatisfactory issue; what is thus to be preserved is but a
counterfeit of our being, and even that counterfeit is confronted by
omens of a total extinction more or less remote. A note of failure and
melancholy must always dominate in the struggle against natural death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intellectual victory over change.</div>

<p>This defeat is not really problematical, or to be eluded by reviving
ill-digested hopes resting entirely on ignorance, an ignorance which
these hopes will wish to make eternal. We need not wait for our total
death to experience dying; we need not borrow from observation of
others' demise a prophecy of our own extinction. Every moment
cele<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260" />brates obsequies over the virtues of its predecessor; and the
possession of memory, by which we somehow survive in representation, is
the most unmistakable proof that we are perishing in reality. In
endowing us with memory, nature has revealed to us a truth utterly
unimaginable to the unflective creation, the truth of mortality.
Everything moves in the midst of death, because it indeed <i>moves</i>; but
it falls into the pit unawares and by its own action unmakes and
disestablishes itself, until a wonderful visionary faculty is added, so
that a ghost remains of what has perished to reveal that lapse and at
the same time in a certain sense to neutralise it. The more we reflect,
the more we live in memory and idea, the more convinced and penetrated
we shall be by the experience of death; yet, without our knowing it,
perhaps, this very conviction and experience will have raised us, in a
way, above mortality. That was a heroic and divine oracle which, in
informing us of our decay, made us partners of the gods' eternity, and
by giving us knowledge poured into us, to that extent, the serenity and
balm of truth. As it is memory that enables us to feel that we are dying
and to know that everything actual is in flux, so it is memory that
opens to us an ideal immortality, unacceptable and meaningless to the
old Adam, but genuine in its own way and undeniably true. It is an
immortality in representation&mdash;a representation which envisages things
in their truth as <a name="Page_261" id="Page_261" />they have in their own day possessed themselves in
reality. It is no subterfuge or superstitious effrontery, called to
disguise or throw off the lessons of experience; on the contrary, it is
experience itself, reflection itself, and knowledge of mortality. Memory
does not reprieve or postpone the changes which it registers, nor does
it itself possess a permanent duration; it is, if possible, less stable
and more mobile than primary sensation. It is, in point of existence,
only an internal and complex kind of sensibility. But in intent and by
its significance it plunges to the depths of time; it looks still on the
departed and bears witness to the truth that, though absent from this
part of experience, and incapable of returning to life, they
nevertheless existed once in their own right, were as living and actual
as experience is to-day, and still help to make up, in company with all
past, present, and future mortals, the filling and value of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The glory of it.</div>

<p>As the pathos and heroism of life consists in accepting as an
opportunity the fate that makes our own death, partial or total,
serviceable to others, so the glory of life consists in accepting the
knowledge of natural death as an opportunity to live in the spirit. The
sacrifice, the self-surrender, remains real; for, though the
compensation is real, too, and at moments, perhaps, apparently
overwhelming, it is always incomplete and leaves beneath an incurable
sorrow. Yet life can never contradict its basis or reach satisfactions
essentially excluded by its own conditions. Progress lies in <a name="Page_262" id="Page_262" />moving
forward from the given situation, and satisfying as well as may be the
interests that exist. And if some initial demand has proved hopeless,
there is the greater reason for cultivating other sources of
satisfaction, possibly more abundant and lasting. Now, reflection is a
vital function; memory and imagination have to the full the rhythm and
force of life. But these faculties, in envisaging the past or the ideal,
envisage the eternal, and the man in whose mind they predominate is to
that extent detached in his affections from the world of flux, from
himself, and from his personal destiny. This detachment will not make
him infinitely long-lived, nor absolutely happy, but it may render him
intelligent and just, and may open to him all intellectual pleasures and
all human sympathies.</p>

<p>There is accordingly an escape from death open to man; one not found by
circumventing nature, but by making use of her own expedients in
circumventing her imperfections. Memory, nay, perception itself, is a
first stage in this escape, which coincides with the acquisition and
possession of reason. When the meaning of successive perceptions is
recovered with the last of them, when a survey is made of objects whose
constitutive sensations first arose independently, this synthetic moment
contains an object raised above time on a pedestal of reflection, a
thought indefeasibly true in its ideal deliverance, though of course
fleeting in its psychic existence. Existence is essentially <a name="Page_263" id="Page_263" />temporal
and life foredoomed to be mortal, since its basis is a process and an
opposition; it floats in the stream of time, never to return, never to
be recovered or repossessed. But ever since substance became at some
sensitive point intelligent and reflective, ever since time made room
and pause for memory, for history, for the consciousness of time, a god,
as it were, became incarnate in mortality and some vision of truth, some
self-forgetful satisfaction, became a heritage that moment could
transmit to moment and man to man. This heritage is humanity itself, the
presence of immortal reason in creatures that perish. Apprehension,
which makes man so like a god, makes him in one respect immortal; it
quickens his numbered moments with a vision of what never dies, the
truth of those moments and their inalienable values.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reason makes man's divinity.</div>

<p>To participate in this vision is to participate at once in humanity and
in divinity, since all other makes bonds are material and perishable,
but the bond between two thoughts that have grasped the same truth, of
two instants that have caught the same beauty, is a spiritual and
imperishable bond. It is imperishable simply because it is ideal and
resident merely in import and intent. The two thoughts, the two
instants, remain existentially different; were they not two they could
not come from different quarters to unite in one meaning and to behold
one object in distinct and conspiring acts of apprehension. Being
independent in existence, they can <a name="Page_264" id="Page_264" />be united by the identity of their
burden, by the common worship, so to speak, of the same god. Were this
ideal goal itself an existence, it would be incapable of uniting
anything; for the same gulf which separated the two original minds would
open between them and their common object. But being, as it is, purely
ideal, it can become the meeting-ground of intelligences and render
their union ideally eternal. Among the physical instruments of thought
there may be rivalry and impact&mdash;the two thinkers may compete and
clash&mdash;but this is because each seeks his own physical survival and does
not love the truth stripped of its accidental associations and
provincial accent. Doctors disagree in so far as they are not truly
doctors, but, as Plato would say, seek, like sophists and wage-earners,
to circumvent and defeat one another. The conflict is physical and can
extend to the subject-matter only in so far as this is tainted by
individual prejudice and not wholly lifted from the sensuous to the
intellectual plane. In the ether there are no winds of doctrine. The
intellect, being the organ and source of the divine, is divine and
single; if there were many sorts of intellect, many principles of
perspective, they would fix and create incomparable and irrelevant
worlds. Reason is one in that it gravitates toward an object, called
truth, which could not have the function it has, of being a focus for
mental activities, if it were not one in reference to the operations
which converge upon it.</p>

<p><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265" />This unity in truth, as in reason, is of course functional only, not
physical or existential. The heats of thought and the thinkers are
innumerable; indefinite, too, the variations to which their endowment
and habits may be subjected. But the condition of spiritual communion or
ideal relevance in these intelligences is their possession of a method
and grammar essentially identical. Language, for example, is significant
in proportion to the constancy in meaning which words and locutions
preserve in a speaker's mind at various times, or in the minds of
various persons. This constancy is never absolute. Therefore language is
never wholly significant, never exhaustively intelligible. There is
always mud in the well, if we have drawn up enough water. Yet in
peaceful rivers, though they flow, there is an appreciable degree of
translucency. So, from moment to moment, and from man to man, there is
an appreciable element of unanimity, of constancy and congruity of
intent. On this abstract and perfectly identical function science rests
together with every rational formation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and his immortality.</div>

<p>The same function is the seat of human immortality. Reason lifts a
larger or smaller element in each man to the plane of ideality according
as reason more or less thoroughly leavens and permeates the lump. No man
is wholly immortal, as no philosophy is wholly true and no language
wholly intelligible; but only in so far as intelligible is a language a
language rather <a name="Page_266" id="Page_266" />than a noise, only in so far as true is a philosophy
more than a vent for cerebral humours, and only in so far as a man is
rational and immortal is he a man and not a sensorium.</p>

<p>It is hard to convince people that they have such a gift as
intelligence. If they perceive its animal basis they cannot conceive its
ideal affinities or understand what is meant by calling it divine; if
they perceive its ideality and see the immortal essences that swim into
its ken, they hotly deny that it is an animal faculty, and invent
ultramundane places and bodiless persons in which it is to reside; as if
those celestial substances could be, in respect to thought, any less
material than matter or, in respect to vision and life, any less
instrumental than bodily organs. It never occurs to them that if nature
has added intelligence to animal life it is because they belong
together. Intelligence is a natural emanation of vitality. If eternity
could exist otherwise than as a vision in time, eternity would have no
meaning for men in the world, while the world, men, and time would have
no vocation or status in eternity. The travail of existence would be
without excuse, without issue or consummation, while the conceptions of
truth and of perfection would be without application to experience, pure
dreams about things preternatural and unreal, vacantly conceived, and
illogically supposed to have something to do with living issues. But
truth and perfection, for the very reason that they are not problematic
existences but in<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267" />herent ideals, cannot be banished from discourse.
Experience may lose any of its data; it cannot lose, while it endures,
the terms with which it operates in becoming experience. Now, truth is
relevant to every opinion which looks to truth for its standard, and
perfection is envisaged in every cry for relief, in every effort at
betterment. Opinions, volitions, and passionate refusals fill human
life. So that when the existence of truth is denied, truth is given the
only status which it ever required&mdash;it is conceived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is the locus of all truths.</div>

<p>Nor can any better defense be found for the denial that nature and her
life have a status in eternity. This statement may not be understood,
but if grasped at all it will not be questioned. By having a status in
eternity is not meant being parts of an eternal existence, petrified or
congealed into something real but motionless. What is meant is only that
whatever exists in time, when bathed in the light of reflection,
acquires an indelible character and discloses irreversible relations;
every fact, in being recognised, takes its place in the universe of
discourse, in that ideal sphere of truth which is the common and
unchanging standard for all assertions. Language, science, art,
religion, and all ambitious dreams are compacted of ideas. Life is as
much a mosaic of notions as the firmament is of stars; and these ideal
and transpersonal objects, bridging time, fixing standards, establishing
values, constituting the natural rewards of all liv<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268" />ing, are the very
furniture of eternity, the goals and playthings of that reason which is
an instinct in the heart as vital and spontaneous as any other. Or
rather, perhaps, reason is a supervening instinct by which all other
instincts are interpreted, just as the <i>sensus communis</i> or
transcendental unity of psychology is a faculty by which all perceptions
are brought face to face and compared. So that immortality is not a
privilege reserved for a part only of experience, but rather a relation
pervading every part in varying measure. We may, in leaving the subject,
mark the degrees and phases of this idealisation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Epicurean immortality, through the truth of existence.</div>

<p>Animal sensation is related to eternity only by the truth that it has
taken place. The fact, fleeting as it is, is registered in ideal history
and no inventory of the world's riches, no true confession of its
crimes, would ever be complete that ignored that incident. This
indefeasible character in experience makes a first sort of ideal
immortality, one on which those rational philosophers like to dwell who
have not speculation enough to feel quite certain of any other. It was a
consolation to the Epicurean to remember that, however brief and
uncertain might be his tenure of delight, the past was safe and the
present sure. &quot;He lives happy,&quot; says Horace, &quot;and master over himself,
who can say daily, I have lived. To-morrow let Jove cover the sky with
black clouds or flood it with sunshine; he shall not thereby render
<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269" />vain what lies behind, he shall not delete and make never to have
existed what once the hour has brought in its flight.&quot; Such
self-concentration and hugging of the facts has no power to improve
them; it gives to pleasure and pain an impartial eternity, and rather
tends to intrench in sensuous and selfish satisfactions a mind that has
lost faith in reason and that deliberately ignores the difference in
scope and dignity which exists among various pursuits. Yet the
reflection is staunch and in its way heroic; it meets a vague and feeble
aspiration, that looks to the infinite, with a just rebuke; it points to
real satisfactions, experienced successes, and asks us to be content
with the fulfilment of our own wills. If you have seen the world, if you
have played your game and won it, what more would you ask for? If you
have tasted the sweets of existence, you should be satisfied; if the
experience has been bitter, you should be glad that it comes to an end.</p>

<p>Of course, as we have seen, there is a primary demand in man which death
and mutation contradict flatly, so that no summons to cease can ever be
obeyed with complete willingness. Even the suicide trembles and the
ascetic feels the stings of the flesh. It is the part of philosophy,
however, to pass over those natural repugnances and overlay them with as
much countervailing rationality as can find lodgment in a particular
mind. The Epicurean, having abandoned politics and religion and being
afraid of any far-reaching ambition, <a name="Page_270" id="Page_270" />applied philosophy honestly enough
to what remained. Simple and healthy pleasures are the reward of simple
and healthy pursuits; to chafe against them because they are limited is
to import a foreign and disruptive element into the case; a healthy
hunger has its limit, and its satisfaction reaches a natural term.
Philosophy, far from alienating us from those values, should teach us to
see their perfection and to maintain them in our ideal. In other words,
the happy filling of a single hour is so much gained for the universe at
large, and to find joy and sufficiency in the flying moment is perhaps
the only means open to us for increasing the glory of eternity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Logical immortality, through objects of thought.</div>

<p>Moving events, while remaining enshrined in this fashion in their
permanent setting, may contain other and less external relations to the
immutable. They may represent it. If the pleasures of sense are not
cancelled when they cease, but continue to satisfy reason in that they
once satisfied natural desires, much more will the pleasures of
reflection retain their worth, when we consider that what they aspired
to and reached was no momentary physical equilibrium but a permanent
truth. As Archimedes, measuring the hypothenuse, was lost to events,
being engaged in an event of much greater transcendence, so art and
science interrupt the sense for change by engrossing attention in its
issues and its laws. Old age often turns pious to look away from ruins
to some world where youth <a name="Page_271" id="Page_271" />endures and where what ought to have been is
not overtaken by decay before it has quite come to maturity. Lost in
such abstract contemplations, the mind is weaned from mortal concerns.
It forgets for a few moments a world in which it has so little more to
do and so much, perhaps, still to suffer. As a sensation of pure light
would not be distinguishable from light itself, so a contemplation of
things not implicating time in their structure becomes, so far as its
own deliverance goes, a timeless existence. Unconsciousness of temporal
conditions and of the very flight of time makes the thinker sink for a
moment into identity with timeless objects. And so immortality, in a
second ideal sense, touches the mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethical immortality, through types of excellence.</div>

<p>The transitive phases of consciousness, however, have themselves a
reference to eternal things. They yield a generous enthusiasm and love
of good which is richer in consolation than either Epicurean
self-concentration or mathematical ecstasy. Events are more interesting
than the terms we abstract from them, and the forward movement of the
will is something more intimately real than is the catalogue of our past
experiences. Now the forward movement of the will is an avenue to the
eternal. What would you have? What is the goal of your endeavour? It
must be some success, the establishment of some order, the expression of
some experience. These points once reached, we are not left merely with
the satisfaction of ab<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272" />stract success or the consciousness of ideal
immortality. Being natural goals, these ideals are related to natural
functions. Their attainment does not exhaust but merely liberates, in
this instance, the function concerned, and so marks the perpetual point
of reference common to that function in all its fluctuations. Every
attainment of perfection in an art&mdash;as for instance in government&mdash;makes
a return to perfection easier for posterity, since there remains an
enlightening example, together with faculties predisposed by discipline
to recover their ancient virtue. The better a man evokes and realises
the ideal the more he leads the life that all others, in proportion to
their worth, will seek to live after him, and the more he helps them to
live in that nobler fashion. His presence in the society of immortals
thus becomes, so to speak, more pervasive. He not only vanquishes time,
by his own rationality, living now in the eternal, but he continually
lives again in all rational beings.</p>

<p>Since the ideal has this perpetual pertinence to mortal struggles, he
who lives in the ideal and leaves it expressed in society or in art
enjoys a double immortality. The eternal has absorbed him while he
lived, and when he is dead his influence brings others to the same
absorption, making them, through that ideal identity with the best in
him, reincarnations and perennial seats of all in him which he could
rationally hope to rescue from destruction. He can say, without any
subter<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273" />fuge or desire to delude himself, that he shall not wholly die;
for he will have a better notion than the vulgar of what constitutes his
being. By becoming the spectator and confessor of his own death and of
universal mutation, he will have identified himself with what is
spiritual in all spirits and masterful in all apprehension; and so
conceiving himself, he may truly feel and know that he is eternal.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>CONCLUSION</p>


<div class="sidenote">The failure of magic.</div>

<p>The preceding analysis of religion, although it is illustrated mainly by
Christianity, may enable us in a general way to distinguish the rational
goal of all religious life. In no sphere is the contrast clearer between
wisdom and folly; in none, perhaps, has there been so much of both. It
was a prodigious delusion to imagine that work could be done by magic;
and the desperate appeal which human weakness has made to prayer, to
castigations, to miscellaneous fantastic acts, in the hope of thereby
bending nature to greater sympathy with human necessities, is a pathetic
spectacle; all the more pathetic in that here the very importunity of
evil, which distracted the mind and allowed it no choice or
deliberation, prevented very often those practical measures which, if
lighted upon, would have instantly relieved the situation. Religion when
it has tried to do man's work for him has not only cheated hope, but
consumed energy and drawn away attention from the true means of success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and of mythology.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Their imaginative value.</div>

<p>No less useless and retarding has been the <a name="Page_275" id="Page_275" />effort to give religion the
function of science. Mythology, in excogitating hidden dramatic causes
for natural phenomena, or in attributing events to the human values
which they might prevent or secure, has profoundly perverted and
confused the intellect; it has delayed and embarrassed the discovery of
natural forces, at the same time fostering presumptions which, on being
exploded, tended to plunge men, by revulsion, into an artificial
despair. At the same time this experiment in mythology involved
wonderful creations which have a poetic value of their own, to offset
their uselessness in some measure and the obstruction they have
occasioned. In imagining human agents behind every appearance fancy has
given appearances some kinship to human life; it has made nature a mass
of hieroglyphics and enlarged to that extent the means of human
expression. While objects and events were capriciously moralised, the
mind's own plasticity has been developed by its great exercise in
self-projection. To imagine himself a thunder-cloud or a river, the
dispenser of silent benefits and the contriver of deep-seated universal
harmonies, has actually stimulated man's moral nature: he has grown
larger by thinking himself so large.</p>

<p>Through the dense cloud of false thought and bad habit in which religion
thus wrapped the world, some rays broke through from the begin<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276" />ning; for
mythology and magic expressed life and sought to express its conditions.
Human needs and human ideals went forth in these forms to solicit and to
conquer the world; and since these imaginative methods, for their very
ineptitude, rode somewhat lightly over particular issues and envisaged
rather distant goods, it was possible through them to give aspiration
and reflection greater scope than the meaner exigencies of life would
have permitted. Where custom ruled morals and a narrow empiricism
bounded the field of knowledge, it was partly a blessing that
imagination should be given an illegitimate sway. Without
misunderstanding, there might have been no understanding at all; without
confidence in supernatural support, the heart might never have uttered
its own oracles. So that in close association with superstition and
fable we find piety and spirituality entering the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Piety and spirituality justified.</div>

<p>Rational religion has these two phases: piety, or loyalty to necessary
conditions, and spirituality, or devotion to ideal ends. These simple
sanctities make the core of all the others. Piety drinks at the deep,
elemental sources of power and order: it studies nature, honours the
past, appropriates and continues its mission. Spirituality uses the
strength thus acquired, remodelling all it receives, and looking to the
future and the ideal. True religion is entirely human and political, as
was that of the ancient Hebrews, Romans, and Greeks. Super<a name="Page_277" id="Page_277" />natural
machinery is either symbolic of natural conditions and moral aims or
else is worthless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mysticism a primordial state of feeling.</div>

<p>There is one other phase or possible overtone of religion about which a
word might be added in conclusion. What is called mysticism is a certain
genial loosening of convention, whether rational or mythical; the mystic
smiles at science and plays with theology, undermining both by force of
his insight and inward assurance. He is all faith, all love, all vision,
but he is each of these things <i>in vacuo</i>, and in the absence of any
object.</p>

<p>Mysticism can exist, in varied degrees, at any stage of rational
development. Its presence is therefore no indication of the worth or
worthlessness of its possessor. This circumstance tends to obscure its
nature, which would otherwise be obvious enough. Seeing the greatest
saints and philosophers grow mystical in their highest flights, an
innocent observer might imagine that mysticism was an ultimate attitude,
which only his own incapacity kept him from understanding. But exactly
the opposite is the case. Mysticism is the most primitive of feelings
and only visits formed minds in moments of intellectual arrest and
dissolution. It can exist in a child, very likely in an animal; indeed,
to parody a phrase of Hegel's, the only pure mystics are the brutes.
When articulation fails in the face of experience; when instinct guides
without kindling any prophetic idea to which action may be inwardly
re<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278" />ferred; when life and hope and joy flow through the soul from an
unknown region to an unknown end, then consciousness is mystical. Such
an experience may suffuse the best equipped mind, if its primordial
energies, its will and emotions, much outrun its intelligence. Just as
at the beginning pure inexperience may flounder intellectually and yet
may have a sense of not going astray, a sense of being carried by earth
and sky, by contagion and pleasure, into its animal paradise; so at the
end, if the vegetative forces still predominate, all articulate
experience may be lifted up and carried down-stream bodily by the
elementary flood rising from beneath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It may recur at any stage of culture.</div>

<p>Every religion, all science, all art, is accordingly subject to
incidental mysticism; but in no case can mysticism stand alone and be
the body or basis of anything. In the Life of Reason it is, if I may say
so, a normal disease, a recurrent manifestation of lost equilibrium and
interrupted growth; but in these pauses, when the depths rise to the
surface and obliterate what scratches culture may have made there, the
rhythm of life may be more powerfully felt, and the very disappearance
of intellect may be taken for a revelation. Both in a social and a
psychological sense revelations come from beneath, like earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions; and while they fill the spirit with contempt for
those fragile structures which they so easily overwhelm, they are
utterly incapable of <a name="Page_279" id="Page_279" />raising anything on the ruins. If they leave
something standing it is only by involuntary accident, and if they
prepare the soil for anything, it is commonly only for wild-flowers and
weeds. Revelations are seldom beneficent, therefore, unless there is
more evil in the world to destroy than good to preserve; and mysticism,
under the same circumstances, may also liberate and relieve the spirit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Form gives substance its life and value.</div>

<p>The feelings which in mysticism rise to the surface and speak in their
own name are simply the ancient, overgrown feelings of vitality,
dependence, inclusion; they are the background of consciousness coming
forward and blotting out the scene. What mysticism destroys is, in a
sense, its only legitimate expression. The Life of Reason, in so far as
it is life, contains the mystic's primordial assurances, and his
rudimentary joys; but in so far as it is rational it has discovered what
those assurances rest on, in what direction they may be trusted to
support action and thought; and it has given those joys distinction and
connexion, turning a dumb momentary ecstasy into a many-coloured and
natural happiness.<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280" /></p>
